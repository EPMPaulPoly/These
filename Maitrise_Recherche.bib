	abstract = {Recent policy interest in managing local population growth has drawn attention to the fiscal pressures that population growth imposes on local governments. This paper uses 1985 data for 247 large county areas to determine the separate impacts on local government spending of two dimensions of residential development patterns, the rapidity of population growth and the intensity of land use as measured by gross residential densities. Based on a regression model that controls for other determinants of per capita spending, this study provides careful estimates of the nonlinear impacts of population growth and population density on three types of local government spending: current account spending, capital outlays and spending on public safety. The study balances the engineering and planning view that greater population density lowers the costs of providing public services by documenting a U-shaped relationship between spending and density; except in sparsely populated areas, higher density typically increases public sector spending. In addition, the results suggest that rapid population growth imposes fiscal burdens on established residents in the form of lower service levels.},

	abstract = {Research on car dependence exposes the difficulty of moving away from a car-dominated, high-carbon transport system, but neglects the political-economic factors underpinning car-dependent societies. Yet these factors are key constraints to attempts to ‘decouple' human well-being from energy use and climate change emissions. In this critical review paper, we identify some of the main political-economic factors behind car dependence, drawing together research from several fields. Five key constituent elements of what we call the ‘car-dependent transport system’ are identified: i) the automotive industry; ii) the provision of car infrastructure; iii) the political economy of urban sprawl; iv) the provision of public transport; v) cultures of car consumption. Using the ‘systems of provision’ approach within political economy, we locate the part played by each element within the key dynamic processes of the system as a whole. Such processes encompass industrial structure, political-economic relations, the built environment, and cultural feedback loops. We argue that linkages between these processes are crucial to maintaining car dependence and thus create carbon lock-in. In developing our argument we discuss several important characteristics of car-dependent transport systems: the role of integrated socio-technical aspects of provision, the opportunistic use of contradictory economic arguments serving industrial agendas, the creation of an apolitical façade around pro-car decision-making, and the ‘capture’ of the state within the car-dependent transport system. Through uncovering the constituents, processes and characteristics of car-dependent transport systems, we show that moving past the automobile age will require an overt and historically aware political program of research and action.},

	abstract = {Parking space management systems help organize and optimize available parking spaces for consumers, making the process of finding and using parking spaces more efficient. Current parking space management systems include manual recognition, the employment of magnetic and ultrasonic sensors, and, recently, computer vision (CV). One relatively new region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) model, Mask R-CNN, has shown promise in its ability to detect objects and has demonstrated superior performance over many other popular CV methods. Building on Mask R-CNN, an updated version, Rotated Mask R-CNN, which can generate bounding boxes the axes of which are rotated with respect to the image’s axis, was proposed to address the limitation of Mask R-CNN. Albeit with the documented theoretical benefits, the application of the rotated version is rare because of its recent invention. To this end, the study aims to detect vehicle instances in one parking lot using various Rotated Mask R-CNN models based on unmanned aircraft system collected images. Both average precision and average recall were utilized to assess the performance of the alternative models with different backbone and head networks. The results reveal the high accuracy level associated with Rotated Mask R-CNN in real-time detection of vehicles. In addition, the results indicate that the inference speed and total loss are highly correlated with head networks and training schedules.},

It is obvious that these methodological decisions would greatly affect the internal and external validity and the overall generalizability of the study findings. This paper has comprehensively updated the guidelines on sampling methods and sample size calculation, hence giving enough evidence that will be beneficial in assisting researchers to advance the credibility and statistical power of their research work. The differences between probability sampling techniques, including simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling, and non-probability methods, such as convenience sampling, purposive sampling, and snowball sampling, have been fully explained. Probability is the only that can ensure the generalizability, while non-probability sampling is useful in exploratory situations. Another significant process is the determination of an optimal sample size, which, among other things, has to take into account the total population size, effect size, statistical power, confidence level, and margin of error. The paper contributes both theoretical guidance and practical tools that researchers need in choosing appropriate strategies for sampling and validating methodologically appropriate sample size calculations. In sum, such a paper sets the standard for best practice in research methodology that will drive reliability, validity, and empirical rigor across diverse studies.},

	abstract = {Minimum parking requirements (MPRs) are the norm for urban and suburban development in the United States (Davidson et al., 2002). The justification for MPRs is that overflow parking will occupy nearby street or off-street parking. Shoup (1999a) and Willson (1995) provide cases where there is reason to believe that parking space requirements have forced parcel developers to place more parking than they would in the absence of parking requirements. However, to our knowledge the existing literature does not test the effect of parking minimums on the amount of lot space devoted to parking beyond a few case studies. This paper tests the hypothesis that MPRs bind for most land uses using data on suburban office, commercial, industrial and retail property sales from Los Angeles County using both direct and indirect approaches. Our indirect test of the effects of parking requirements is similar to the one used by Glaeser and Gyourko (2003). A simple theoretical model shows that the marginal value of additional parking to the sale price of a building should be equal to the cost of land plus the cost of parking construction. We estimate the marginal values of parking and lot area with spatial methods using a large data set from the Los Angeles area non-residential property sales and find that for most of the property types the marginal value of parking is significantly below that of the parcel area. In addition, we directly examine required and supplied parking and find that on average parking supplied is quite close to the required amount.},

This paper examines this question using a panel dataset of U.S. urban county areas and a specification allowing for potential nonlinearity between development patterns and per capita expenditures. Estimates indicate that the spatial extent of development is the most important factor in expenditures; it is less costly to provide public services when development is more compact. Higher density increases per capita expenditures; however, the effects are small.},

	abstract = {P Report 39 will be of interest to individuals involved in ongoing discussions and debates about urban sprawl and its effects. This report is a literature review that represents the culmination of the first phase of TCRP Project H-10, "The Costs of Sprawl—Revisited." The report was prepared by Rutgers University's Center for Urban Policy Research, in conjunction with The Brookings Institution, Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade and Douglas, Inc., and ECONorthwest. Urban sprawl is a topic that interests urban planners, economists, environmentalists, sociologists, transportation professionals, policymakers and public officials, academics in many fields, and the general public.
Regardless of the focus of any particular debate or discussion on urban sprawl, most such discussions attempt to define sprawl and address whether it is "good" or "bad." Consequently, Chapter 1 of Section I of TCRP Report 39 provides a working definition of sprawl and its associated costs. The next chapter provides historical discussion, dating back to the early 1920s when zoning acts were initially developed, and to the 1950s when the term "sprawl" entered the planning literature. As indicated by the title of this research project, the seminal 1974 report The Costs of Sprawl, prepared by the Real Estate Research Corporation, serves as a springboard for this research effort.
Section II of the report contains the Literature Synthesis. This section systematically presents the literature on sprawl in chapters that focus on the following major areas of impact:
• Public/private capital and operating costs,
• Transportation and travel costs,
• Land/natural habitat preservation,
• Quality of life, and
• Social issues.
Throughout this section, the research team discusses the literature and identifies the extent to which there is agreement and disagreement about the premises and conclusions. Section III of the report presents annotations of studies, organized in chapters that focus on the same five major impact areas as Section II. While this report will not resolve the debate on the benefits and costs of urban sprawl, it provides an important repository of information for the debaters.},

TCRP Report 74, which represents the second and final phase of TCRP Project H-10, “The Costs of Sprawl Revisited,” will therefore be of interest to those engaged in the discussions and debates about urban sprawl and its effects. The report was prepared by Robert Burchell, george Lowenstein, William Dolphin, and Catherine Galley of the Center for Urban Policy Research, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey; Anthony Downs of The Brookings Institution; Samuel Seskin and Katherine Gray Still of Parsons Brinkerhoff Quade and Douglas, Inc.; and Terry Moore of ECONorthwest.
TCRP Report 74 is the culmination of more than 5 years of research led by Rutgers University. As with most reports on this controversial topic, there was not unanimous agreement among the panel of reviewers in support of the research approach or the conclusions reached; nevertheless, the research results are well documented and clearly presented. The report includes 16 chapters, which are divided into the following four parts:
• Part I—Setting the Scene. The first five chapters of the report provide background information. Chapter 1 addresses sprawl and its historical context in the United States. Chapter 2 defines the terms and describes the databases used in the research project; in particular, the chapter explains the advantages of the county-level analysis used in this national study. Focusing on the period 2000 to 2025, Chapter 3 discusses projected growth in the United States by region, by economic area, and by county. Chapter 4 presents analysis results regarding the incidence of sprawl and the potential for its control through a controlled-growth  scenario. Chapter 5 includes an analysis of sprawl in 15 economic areas.
• Part II—The Impact of Sprawl on Resources. Chapters 6 through 10 present the results of five different models: land conversion, water and sewer infrastructure, local road infrastructure, local public-service costs, and real estate development costs. In each case, model results are presented and compared by region,
by state, by county, and by economic area for projected sprawl development and for the controlled-growth scenario for the United States as a whole. The findings include resource consumption and the associated financial implications.
• Part III—The Personal Costs of Sprawl. Chapters 11, 12, and 13 examine the personal costs of sprawl, including its impact on individual travel costs (for both privately operated vehicles and transit), quality of life, and the livability of cities. Each chapter presents the results of different modeling analyses. Chapters 11 and 12 include comparisons between the controlled- and noncontrolled-growth scenarios. Chapter 13 seeks out empirical evidence regarding possible relationships between urban sprawl and urban decline.
• Part IV—Dealing with Sprawl. Chapter 14 examines 13 benefits of sprawl, which are grouped into four categories: housing, transportation, land planning, and quality-of-life and social benefits. Chapter 15 is directed to policymakers and those interested in taking remedial action against the negative effects of sprawl.
Various tactics and strategies for reducing the negative effects of sprawl are presented and evaluated. Chapter 16 identifies more than 40 topics for future research on sprawl and its impact},

	abstract = {This paper examines the impact of urban sprawl, a phenomenon of particular interest in Spain, which is currently experiencing this process of rapid, low-density urban expansion. Many adverse consequences are attributed to urban sprawl (such as traffic congestion, air pollution and social segregation), although this paper is concerned primarily with the rising costs of providing local public services. The initial aim is to develop an accurate measure of urban sprawl so that its impact on municipal budgets can be tested empirically. Then, an empirical analysis is undertaken using a crosssectional dataset of 2500 Spanish municipalities for the year 2003 and a piece-wise linear function to account for the potentially non-linear relationship between sprawl and local costs. The estimations derived from the expenditure equations for both aggregate and six disaggregated spending categories indicate that low-density development patterns lead to greater provision costs of local public services.},

There is no statistically significant relationship between per capita total government expenditures and operational expenditures for cities smaller than 500,000, and for larger cities, higher population density is associated with higher per capita government expenditures. Infrastructure expenditures tend to decline with increases in population density for cities smaller than 500,000, whereas expenditures on services tend to increase with population density for cities larger than 500,000. The relationship between per capita total expenditures and population density has policy relevance because it indicates that when all government expenditures are taken into account, policies that increase population density will not reduce per capita government expenditures and, in larger cities, will lead to higher per capita government expenditures.},

We find that denser cities devote a greater share of their land to streets, but also have less street space per person. This relationship results in part from the difficulty of constructing new streets in built-out areas. The amount of street space does not increase as fast as population density, and this in turn helps explain why dense areas have less vehicle travel per person but higher levels of congestion. In contrast to streets, new off-street parking is supplied continually, owing largely to minimum parking requirements that make new development contingent on the provision of parking spaces. But the ample supply of off-street parking makes traffic congestion worse and inhibits street life. We recommend either removing off-street parking requirements, or converting them from minimums to maximums. Journal of Urban Planning and Development © ASCE.},

If goods are heterogeneous and some consumers engage in multiple-stop shopping (i.e., shop both downtown and in the suburbs), suburban stores will not lobby at all; lobbying by downtown retailers leads to parking fees below the social optimum. Furthermore, local residents do not necessarily lobby for high parking fees on downtown shoppers. If a decline in urban stores leads to negative externalities (urban blight) they may join forces with downtown retailers and lobby against high parking fees on shoppers.},

	abstract = {Parking space near popular destinations is often scarce or expensive. Instead, visitors may park in adjoining locales where they impede through traffic, take parking space from other users, and create environmental externalities. We develop a model to study spillover parking generated by a major retailer (e.g., a mall)that provides limited on-site parking. Some customers park at the mall, some park on the street, and others who live or work nearby visit the mall on foot. The retailer chooses its parking lot capacity, the parking fee, and the retail markup. We compare the effectiveness of four policies for dealing with spillover parking: on-street parking fees, on-street parking bans (aka residential parking permits), regulating mall parking fees, and regulating mall parking capacity (aka minimum/maximum parking requirements). Policy effectiveness depends on the severity of congestion, the amount of mall shopping by local and nonlocal shoppers, and the mall's market power. A curbside parking ban is harmful unless congestion is severe. If the mall has no market power, both on-street parking fees and mall parking fee regulation can support the social optimum, whereas mall parking lot capacity regulation is useless. In contrast, if the mall has substantial market power, capacity regulation in the form of a minimum parking requirement can be the most effective policy. The benefits of implementing pairs of policies can be larger, or smaller, than the sum of the benefits from applying them individually. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings
Cities today face considerable land use, environmental, and economic challenges resulting from policies prioritizing automobiles and requiring ample off-street parking. In an effort to influence travel behavior and reduce parking supply, Buffalo (NY) adopted the Green Code in 2017. This zoning code reform repealed minimum parking requirements citywide and provided a “natural experiment” to investigate effects of parking deregulation among 36 major developments in its first 2 years. Our research produced two key findings. First, 47\% of major developments included fewer parking spaces than previously permissible, suggesting earlier minimum parking requirements may have been excessive. Second, mixed-use developments introduced 53\% fewer parking spaces than would have been required by earlier minimum requirements as developers readily took advantage of the newfound possibility to include less off-street parking. Aggregate parking spaces among single-use projects exceeded the earlier minimum requirements, suggesting developers of such projects were less motivated to deviate from accepted practices in determining the parking supply for urban development.

Takeaway for practice
Eliminating parking minimums can reduce unnecessary parking supply and encourage development constrained by excessive minimum requirements. Land use, location, and transportation demand initiatives affect the quantity of off-street parking supplied in response to market conditions. Our findings suggest mixed-use developers are likely to take advantage of the ability to provide less parking in highly accessible locations. Though many developers quickly pivot to the newfound possibilities of providing fewer parking spaces, others continue to meet earlier requirements. Cities of all types stand to benefit from undoing constraining parking policies of the past and allowing developers to transform parking lots to “higher uses.”},

For example, parking availability affects both car ownership and usage, and parking planning can affect both land use and building costs. A tool used in several countries is minimum parking requirements (MPR) and lowering these could be a pathway to more sustainable mobility. However, the actual effects of lower MPR have not systematically been studied. In this paper we present the results of a review of sixteen developments with low MPR in Sweden, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and the UK. Existing research and reports have been analyzed to compare these and draw conclusions on the effect of MPR on mobility patterns and mobility services. In addition, interviews were conducted with representatives from municipalities and developers. Our results indicate that the mobility patterns of individuals in the studied projects are more sustainable than in nearby projects. However, the causality of MPR and mobility is hard to establish due to the risk of self-selection and that all of the studied projects have good prerequisites for sustainable mobility practices. Many of the studied evaluations are also of poor quality with, for example, lack of appropriate control group.},

These policies have been criticized as an implicit subsidy that shifts costs from drivers to the public at large. Others have noted that parking lots and structures can lead to increased water and air pollution. However, there has not been an examination of whether parking, presumably by reducing congestion, generates external benefits. We measure whether nearby parking availability influences commercial property prices after controlling for property characteristics, including on-site parking. We find that publicly accessible parking, such as commercial parking garages, generates significant aggregate externalities. We also find evidence of a significant complementary relationship between building and parking area in property values. This suggests that parking regulation could have a significant impact on property development through its effect on the value of the marginal square foot of building area.},

However, the mechanisms behind these two effects have never been made explicit in the literature. This paper proposes, for each claim, a plausible mechanism relying on the specific choices of housing suppliers and consumers. We propose that MPRs discourage small units because they eliminate the most profitable floorspace/parking bundle to supply to relatively lower-income households. We propose that parking costs may be passed on by reducing the supply of housing on offer at a given price.},

This paper summarizes and evaluates the international literature that deals with social costs as a consequence of suburbanization: comprehensive ‘development impact studies’; studies on ‘public service costs’; and those simulating the local ‘fiscal impact’ of various development scenarios. Such a review is needed because all studies are based on different approaches, methods and scope, as well as differences in the cost items considered. They show significantly different results. Due to the resulting complexity of comparison and evaluation, and the lack of transferability of the results to other areas, a state-of-the-art evaluation is helpful. This paper focuses mainly on the involvement of demographical changes beyond the growth paradigm, the consideration of environmental effects, and the consideration of cost burden/repayment of public costs according to the cost-by-causer principle. Using tabular comparisons of different study types, it is shown that various studies obtained different qualitative and numerical results, depending on the methodology and detail or representing different land-use patterns. Notwithstanding the different international legal frameworks, an international agreement by researchers towards a common methodology is necessary in order to enable more efficient ‘fiscal impact’ analyses as an instrument towards more compact, cost-saving development, and thus avoid unnecessary social costs by increasing the efficiency.},

Based on a regression model that controls for other determinants of per capita spending, this study provides careful estimates of the nonlinear impacts of population growth and population density on three types of local government spending: current account spending, capital outlays and spending on public safety. The study balances the engineering and planning view that greater population density lowers the costs of providing public services by documenting a U-shaped relationship between spending and density; except in sparsely populated areas, higher density typically increases public sector spending. In addition, the results suggest that rapid population growth imposes fiscal burdens on established residents in the form of lower service levels.},

These processes are inseparably connected with the shift of private mobility from green transport modes to cars. Urbanization is always accompanied by the development of physical infrastructure, which requires huge investments and determines the structure of a city over long periods of time. Moreover, it cannot be readily adjusted to changing patterns of the demanded services, e.g., triggered by population shrinking. Thus, the impacts of urban sprawl on the local urban infrastructure asset represent complex and important issues to be considered in this context. This comparative study, conducted for the metropolitan regions of Nagoya in Japan and Munich in Germany, correlated six land-use patterns and two mobility parameters with the complexity of urban infrastructure by multiple regression modeling. The result confirms the impact of density on public infrastructure stock and additionally shows that there are other relevant parameters of urban sprawl beyond density, such as the concentration of urban development. The saving potential, which was calculated as the monetary cost difference between the most infrastructure- efficient and most inefficient municipalities, is 85\% on average for Munich and 57\% for the Nagoya region for sewage, primary schools, and local roads. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Said formulas facilitate not only the assessment of the area's economic balance but also the analysis at the local or supralocal level of each variable's economic role. Its application in a sample of Spanish cities with populations between 100,000 and 300,000 inhabitants has shown that, for these cities, municipal revenues depend equally on floor area ratio, property values, and housing density, while expenditures do so first, on relative length of road and second, on housing density. Economic sustainability from the municipal standpoint is usually achieved when housing density ranges from 40 to 80 dwellings per hectare. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

This paper presents a thorough investigation of infrastructure funding flows to increase understanding, to catalyze further investigation in other jurisdictions, and to identify best practices. By using data from Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, funding was mapped for the four tiers of government—federal, provincial, regional, and municipal—contributing to infrastructure. The results demonstrate that significant opacity exists around municipal reserve funds and intergovernmental transfers because insufficient recording is associated with the origin revenues of these funds: where moneys first enter the government cycle. To compare across infrastructure systems, funding from each tier was used to find an average revenue share and estimated per capita funding per source for the water system and three transportation systems: auto, transit, and active transportation. Water infrastructure was funded through six origin revenue sources, with user fees and development charges funding 95\% of expenditures. For transportation infrastructure, the auto system was funded through 16 origin revenue sources, transit through 13, and active transportation through seven. The auto and active transportation systems were 75\% funded through mixtures of property tax, user fees, and development charges. The transit system received significant contributions from nonregional revenue sources because of capital projects developed in the study period. Active transportation, water, and parking expenditures are shown to use effective revenue sources, while transit and other auto expenditures used less effective sources because of the wide range of origin revenue sources. © 2017, SAGE Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {There is a major housing affordability crisis in many American metropolitan areas, particularly for renters. Minimum parking requirements in municipal zoning codes drive up the price of housing, and thus represent an important potential for reform for local policymakers. The relationship between parking and housing prices, however, remains poorly understood. We use national American Housing Survey data and hedonic regression techniques to investigate this relationship. We find that the cost of garage parking to renter households is approximately {\textbackslash}1,700 per year, or an additional 17\% of a housing unit’s rent. In addition to the magnitude of this transport cost burden being effectively hidden in housing prices, the lack of rental housing without bundled parking imposes a steep cost on carless renters—commonly the lowest income households—who may be paying for parking that they do not need or want. We estimate the direct deadweight loss for carless renters to be {\textbackslash}440 million annually. We conclude by suggesting cities reduce or eliminate minimum parking requirements, and allow and encourage landlords to unbundle parking costs from housing costs.},

	abstract = {Using the new U-Pass Program at the University of British Columbia as a case study, this paper provides an analysis of the conditions and strategies necessary for effective transportation demand management in the university and college campus context. Following several years of incremental changes in travel behaviour, a mandatory universal transit pass (U-Pass) was introduced at UBC in September 2003, generating a fifty percent increase in transit ridership and a twenty percent decrease in single occupant vehicle traffic. Drawing on TDM theory and travel behaviour data from the literature, the paper examines the factors contributing to the success of the U-Pass, including demographic data, transit and transportation facilities, and campus housing and land use. The paper places special emphasis on parking policy and regional planning obligations and objectives. The first section provides a review of the literature on transportation demand management through the analysis of TDM tools and policy approaches and their effect on transportation choice. The analysis is focussed on the effect of transportation cost and pricing policy on travel behaviour, with particular emphasis on the university setting. The second section discusses the factors underlying demand management at UBC, including demographic conditions, transportation and land use patterns, and parking policy. Using transportation mode split data from 1997 to the present, the third section examines the impact of TDM strategies implemented at UBC between 1997 (the beginning of its TDM program) and 2003, when U-Pass was implemented. Finally, the paper provides a comparative analysis of other North American U-Pass programs, including their objectives and TDM impact. Based on this analysis, the paper finds that the most effective TDM strategies are those that both increase the cost of operating a single occupant vehicle (SOV) and provide a practical alternative. These types of strategies are particularly well suited to university and college campuses, where large numbers of commuters flow in and out of a central area, and where mandatory policies and fees can more easily be applied. The lessons learned at UBC have important implications for other universities and post secondary institutions seeking to address the costs of increased traffic congestion and parking requirements. The paper concludes by exploring other opportunities for universal transit pass programs, including applications in community and corporate environments.},

	abstract = {Surface parking generates multiple externalities. If left to the market the supply of parking is likely to be suboptimal. But parking requirements ignore most of the externalities. This paper suggests that a tax approach may be a more efficient method to internalize the externalities associated with parking provision, thereby assuring an optimal supply of parking. However, in practice it is infeasible to value all externalities in monetary terms and to set such a tax. Hence, a suboptimal flat surface parking tax is advanced. In addition to its contribution to the reduction of externalities from land cover, this tax is likely to have several noteworthy positive attributes. It is simple to assess. It will provide an incentive for intensifying the use of parking. It may also increase the attractiveness of providing underground parking relative to surface parking, thereby reducing the attractiveness of suburban retail centers relative to central cities. A discussion of implementation issues suggests that a surface parking tax may face relatively low transaction costs. These will be largely a function of the use of revenues. Hence, the use of revenues should be specified when such a tax is proposed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

How these parking requirements influence housing affordability is examined. The provision of parking spaces requires land, building materials, and equipment, which increase the price of housing. On the other hand, it is a common belief that off-street parking requirements prevent streets from being overcrowded with parked cars. In a case study of six neighborhoods in the city of San Francisco, the influence on housing affordability of code-required parking was studied. A hedonic model was fit to data that described housing and neighborhood characteristics to explain statistically the sales price of housing units that changed hands in those neighborhoods in 1996. The analysis revealed that single-family houses and condominiums were more than 10 percent more costly if they included off-street parking than if they did not. Based on the selling prices and the distribution of incomes of San Francisco residents, it was estimated that tens of thousands of additional households could qualify for home mortgages for units without off-street parking if those units could be provided legally under zoning and subdivision ordinances. The policy implications of this finding include the possible consideration of alternative forms of regulation pertaining to the provision of off-street parking in residential projects.},

These local ordinances also shape land use outcomes, such as density, and social outcomes, such as housing affordability. This paper reports on a study of parking requirements for income-restricted, affordable multifamily housing. This form of land use is of particular interest because of its cost sensitivity and controversial nature. The study reported here used household surveys and overnight occupancy counts to assess the use of parking across varied types of income-restricted, affordable housing in the city of San Diego, California. Overall, the use of parking was found to be slightly less than one-half the rate for all rental units in San Diego but varied across affordable housing types (e.g., for families versus for seniors), location (e.g., access to mass transit, opportunity to walk), and bedroom count. This paper concludes with a discussion of methodologies to measure parking use and suggests a sequential policy process to establish affordable housing parking requirements.},

Because no well-developed, formal market for parking spaces exists, this study attempted to estimate the implicit price of aboveground or underground parking spaces for condominiums located in central Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Through the use of two real estate data sets, this study employed the hedonic method and tested for the presence of heteroskedasticity and for spatial autocorrelation when possible. Overall, the results suggested that consumers of bundled parking spaces received a large discount on such spaces. If the retail price were increased to include additional parking spaces, the higher price would not fully reflect the cost to provide such spaces. The affordability of housing might be adversely affected nonetheless. Developers, who are likely to be burdened by some of this indirect parking subsidy, may ultimately provide less housing to the market, which will lead to a higher market-clearing price. This study provided further empirical evidence to support the argument against the imposition of minimum parking space requirements. The requirements are likely to cause an oversupply of parking at multifamily residential developments.},

	abstract = {Increasingly sophisticated and affordable technology for roads and vehicles provides opportunity to conceptualise a national road use management strategy that exploits capabilities of intelligent systems. This paper outlines such a strategy that would enable for all vehicles, nation-wide, measurement, monitoring and reporting of data for driver information and education, safety, law enforcement, emergency response, research and other purposes with major safety and economic benefits. The concept includes installation of low cost data acquisition and communication units in all motor vehicles communicating with a central management system. In-vehicle units, whether part of the strategy or vehicle-manufacturer supplied, would monitor vehicles' location, velocity and acceleration, and transmit data only for safety, emergency, law enforcement and research, with appropriate privacy protection. The units would store road system data. Continuous monitoring of every motor vehicle with appropriate algorithms would enable for all vehicles, nation-wide: • highly intelligent law enforcement (e.g. average as well as instantaneous speed, red light infringement, etc.); • immediate reporting of emergencies (e.g. excessive deceleration, overturning), even in remote locations; • automated collection of tolls, parking fees and other access charges without collection infrastructure; • flexible traffic regulation in congestion zones, residential zones, etc.; • access management of specific vehicle types (e.g. dangerous goods, heavy vehicles); • alerting drivers to hazards; • 'black box' analysis; • anonymous data collection for research, and potentially other applications. The major challenges are in social and political arenas, because full benefit will be achieved only if the system is implemented universally, and that would give rise to significant social and privacy policy issues. These are discussed, along with implementation strategies, such as trialling with certain classes of vehicles, and further research directions.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In recent decades there has been increasing focus on the development of compact and accessible urban environments, in part based on the reasoning that this can help to reduce the transportation requirements of city residents. Travel intensive land uses such as office workplaces are often offered incentives from policy makers to relocate to central locations well served by public transport (transit oriented development). To date, the academic literature on integrated transport and land use planning has largely been focused on the reduction of private car usage and promotion of public transport. This paper adds a complementary dimension, testing the hypothesis that intra-city workplace relocation towards city centres promotes walking and bicycling. Methods: This paper uses a comparative case study method. Employee travel surveys were conducted before and after the 2015 relocation of an office workplace in Trondheim, Norway from urban periphery to city centre. Three similar office relocation cases in Trondheim and Oslo (post-2000) are used for comparison to the case study. Changes in travel distance, time, costs, optimal route and potential for walking and bicycling in the case study are considered alongside actual changes in transport mode. Results: Walking and bicycling levels have a clear inverse relationship with distance to the city centre, due in large part to reduced commuting distances and increased parking costs following relocation. For the case study, the modal share of walking and cycling increased by a factor of 2.5 and 2.8 respectively. Relocation similarly led to a tripling in the number of case study employees who have a commute distance of less than 6 km, the employees’ median acceptable cycling distance. Active commuting levels from the former and current workplace locations match closely with the share of active commuting in the Norwegian National Travel Survey data for the corresponding neighbourhoods. Conclusion: Although the function of workplaces and their employees can vary significantly within a city neighbourhood, travel behaviour is to a large extent determined by supply variables like time and cost. Central workplace locations with good public transport accessibility are shown to create significantly improved opportunities for walking, cycling and public transport commuting compared to peripheral workplaces with little competition to workplace accessibility by car. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	title = {Transit proximity and car parking demand at medium/high density residential developments},
	abstract = {Theory suggests that the demand for private vehicle travel is inversely proportional to the utility of the alternative modes available and by extension, the demand for car parking is directly related to the demand for private vehicle travel. Because transit utility is enhanced by proximity to major public transport nodes (ie bus and rail stations), the opportunity exists to better match parking supply to demand, based on proximity to major public transport nodes. Doing so yields wider benefits to the community in terms of reducing automobile dependency, traffic congestion, urban sprawl and development costs, while at the same time improving active transport, the viability of public transport and liveability in urban spaces. This study examines the relationship between car parking demand and proximity to major public transport nodes, using a sample of medium/high density residential developments in Brisbane, Queensland. Qualitative data was gathered by interviewing a number of local property developers and industry bodies. There is evidence from these interviews that the unique characteristics of a development in conjunction with its proximity to major public transport nodes provide opportunities to reduce the amount of car parking supplied. Quantitative data was obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) for a sample of 150 Census Collector Districts (CCD) in Brisbane, close to major public transport nodes. Car parking demand was regressed against a range of independent variables, including distance to transit, land use diversity, population density and a range of socio-economic parameters. We found that distance to transit has a significant effect on residential car parking demand. This effect was found to be strongest when residential development was within 1,500 metres of a major public transport node, with the most significant effect evident for developments situated within 400 metres. The result of this research has the potential to deliver more sustainable and more affordable land use and transport solutions for major urban areas.},

In addition, this assumption increases the costs of housing in urban areas, which can have a large economic impact.

	abstract = {Millions of people in the United States travel by personal automobile to attend professional sports matches played at various stadiums. Engineering and planning publications lack information on parking provisions for major sporting events. The results from this paper on parking outcomes suggest that the current parking provisions are not efficient. This case study examines parking supply, parking utilization, event auto occupancy, and event auto modal share at four major professional sports venues in the Denver, Colorado, region. The percentage of parking supply per parking demand was calculated for several surveyed games in terms of the average attendance, and parking utilization was evaluated during nonevent periods. In general, the surveys of the games indicated that more parking was provided than was necessary, even when attendance was higher than typical. For an event with average attendance, parking utilization was as low as 65\%, with 2.2 persons per vehicle. In contrast, when parking occupancy was high, auto occupancy increased to 3.0 persons per vehicle. With such different carpool rates, as well as evidence suggesting that spectators who travel to some facilities are willing to park and walk farther than a half-mile, the results suggest that parking supply and travel behavior are endogenous and should not be treated independently. This study also considered parking occupancy at nonevent times and found whole-scale underutilization, even in downtown locations with great opportunity costs.},

This paper seeks to elaborate the line of reasoning accounting for the role of workplace parking and parking policy in the wage negotiation process, the income tax code, regulatory parking standards, and taking into account the adverse effects of parking at the workplace, parking elsewhere or not parking at all. We provide an assessment from two perspectives: firms provide parking spaces, a fringe benefit, if it is profitable to do so (market outcome); a social planner or policymaker endorses workplace parking if it is welfare-enhancing (social optimum). We find that policymakers as well as employers may lack sufficient incentive to reduce parking at the workplace, even in the presence of an employer parking policy program that pursues the goal of making parking opportunity cost visible to employees (parking cash-out). To foster a reduction of employer-paid parking and to exploit the potential welfare gains associated with employee-paid parking, we propose customized local cash-out programs at the firm level rather than uniform fringe benefit taxation enacted by the federal government, provided that cash-out levels account for local particularities (e.g. prevailing traffic conditions, co-existing transport policies), that bargaining power of workers over employers in terms of the incidence of cash-out is limited, and that cash-out as a wage supplement is not subject to income taxation. The (second-best) socially optimal cash-out level need not be identical to the opportunity resource cost of the employer-provided parking space. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {To fulfill Hawaii's housing needs, developers and owners require incentives to be motivated to construct housing. The State subsidized affordable housing, meaning that a portion of the market is unsustainable. Can the State continue to subsidize affordable housing as the cost of production and land increase year over year? Luxury condominiums are one of the few profitable developments in Hawaii, but aside from the subsidized affordable housing, where do other types of housing in between fit into the State's plan? Alternative forms of housing need to be considered as a supplement to affordable housing. A greater diversity of homes at different price points allows all parts of the housing market to grow, creating a more extensive stock of accommodation for the diverse population of the islands. The median nonfamily salary in Hawaii is \$51,343. Those at and below the median salary qualify for affordable housing. Those living above a certain threshold no longer qualify for affordable housing. These people range from single to multi-family households. Greater diversity in higher-priced housing for diverse types of people will allow families and households to find the right fit, freeing up housing that might be suited for another family at a lower or higher income.Hawaii faces a dwindling stock of developable land. However, not all the land is used to its fullest potential. In dense urban areas of Honolulu, where work opportunities are abundant, a few building typologies underutilize valuable urban space. Parking structures are the main culprit, with peak traffic during work hours and little to no traffic at night. While they currently provide an essential service to the dense urban core, their importance could change with future transportation trends. As electric cars with autonomous features gain popularity and accessibility, parking structures may be phased out. Innovations in alternative forms of transportation have also caused fundamental changes in the landscapes of urban cities. Oahu roads have seen the addition of bike lanes. Biki bike rental stations have appeared along these routes in downtown Honolulu. Suppose these trends eventually become a direct competitor to cars. In that case, parking structures will slowly lose their function, creating an opportunity for new developments in the city's most sought-after locations.

	abstract = {This paper aimed at exploring the determinants of household proximity to high-quality transit, particularly within the Indian context. To investigate the proximity of households to metro stations in Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) areas, four binomial logit models were developed. The findings indicate positive associations between parking supply, car ownership, and household proximity to the metro, revealing potential dissonance and car dependency. Thus, regulating parking within TOD areas would be crucial for sustainable transportation. Interestingly, longer travel times for shopping, education, and recreation are positively associated with household proximity within TODs, whereas commuting and shopping by car exhibit negative associations. Notably, negative influences of apartment and house ownership and house rent on household proximity have been observed, but housing varieties contribute positively to residential locations close to the metro. Furthermore, satisfaction with TOD neighborhoods correlates positively with proximity, signaling a lower degree of dissonance. Moreover, household proximity to the metro is positively associated with enhanced non-motorized transportation (NMT) safety at intersections. In addition, higher residential densities, in conjunction with other TOD indicators as shown in the results, are desirable, along with environmentally friendly transportation facilities, to attract people from various socio-demographic groups to live close to transit. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

	abstract = {Rising demand for parking at suburban transit stations, such as the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District in San Francisco, California, necessitates strategies to manage traveler demand. To better manage parking supply, researchers implemented a smart parking field test at the Rockridge BART station from 2004 to 2006 to evaluate the effects of smart parking technologies [changeable message signs (CMSs), Internet reservations and billing, mobile phone and personal digital assistant communications, and a wireless parking lot counting system] on transit ridership and response to service pricing. Researchers used expert interviews, Internet surveys, focus groups, and parking reservation data to conduct this analysis. Survey data indicated that the field test increased BART trips and resulted in 9.7 fewer miles per participant per month on average. Key lessons learned include that it would have been beneficial to anticipate additional time for project scoping and permitting, and that fixed wayfinding signs were beneficial in terms of both directing vehicles from the highway to the smart parking lot and addressing resident concerns about increased traffic. In addition, most participants continued to use the service when fees were implemented. However, CMSs were not widely employed in users' decision-making processes in this application. Finally, the wireless counting system worked well, with the exception of the in-ground sensors, which were prone to miscounts.},

	abstract = {The American University of Beirut (AUB), an urban campus in the city center of Beirut, Lebanon, is seeking solutions to parking and congestion problems in its neighborhood. However, documented Transportation Demand Management (TDM) practices at campuses are mostly from the developed world, and contrast markedly with Beirut, which lacks an organized public transport sector and effective law enforcement. Further, the AUB campus population comes from wealthier households and has higher car ownership compared to the rest of Lebanon. Thus, conventional strategies such as subsidizing transit passes and restricting or pricing parking are not perceived to be appropriate solutions for AUB and many other developing world cases. We examine five American campuses to learn: What are the impacts of increasing campus parking supply? How can transit be promoted without an organized public transit sector? And, how can we incentivize a high-income campus population to use campus transit services? Lessons for AUB are: campus transport services do not always stem from existing public transport services - some campuses have successfully initiated their own transport services; designing a campus transport service catered to the target population can be extremely effective for example in dealing with high-income clients; and ridership on mass transport systems is partly dependent on driving disincentives such as limited, priced parking. Based on these findings, we propose a new mobility solution at AUB, dynamic taxi-sharing, and present preliminary mode shift survey data indicating a potential market and positive reductions in vehicle trips. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Parking management is a strategy that has been extensively employed by authorities and organisations world-wide in an attempt to address traffic-related congestion and associated environmental impacts at a variety of sites and scales. At airports, parking control and pricing regimes are used to generate revenue and manage traffic demand. On the supply side, within the last few years a new trend in unregulated off-site, predominately residential, car parking provision around UK airports has emerged and quickly grown in popularity. Through a survey of three UK-based self-styled 'parking marketplace' websites and an in-depth analysis of one, this paper provides an empirical examination of the growing phenomenon of off-site residential car parking provision around the UK's 25 busiest passenger airports and discusses the potential implications of this niche but growing phenomenon. Data is provided on the supply and the demand for these alternative spaces, as well as their physical location, attributes, and pricing regimes. The empirical findings indicate that, while this currently represents a relatively small proportion of overall airport parking supply it is experiencing rapid growth and may become significant in the future. The paper concludes by contending that airport operators and local authorities need to be cognisant of the existence of, and the challenges and opportunities associated with, alternative parking provision in order to be able to better plan for, and respond to the planning, environmental, and consumer implications it may create. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

But are restaurateurs’ views of the importance of car parking to their trade in line with reality? To explore this question this study surveyed restaurant businesses and customers in parallel at three major restaurant precincts in inner-city Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The novelty of this paper is in being able to cross-analyse business’ perceptions with customers travel behaviour to evaluate the validity of restaurateurs’ perceptions about the importance of car travel and parking, and perceptions about transport infrastructure need. Survey data is adopted to constructed discrete choice models that are used to estimate the restaurant customers’ preference of transport mode for dining in restaurants and simulations on transport cost subsidy used to identify the impact of different policy outcomes. The findings indicate that, unlike restaurateurs’ perceptions, customers who prefer walking, cycling and public transport are more likely to contribute significantly more revenue to the restaurant trade than business owners and managers perceive. The results should help local authorities make better planning decisions about transport infrastructure supply and parking control in conjunction with the restaurant sector as well as help businesses understand that the promotion of sustainable transport options may be more beneficial to their bottom line. © 2015 ATRF, Commonwealth of Australia.

	abstract = {The District of Columbia's Department of Transportation and Office of Planning recently led a research effort to understand how parking utilization in multifamily residential buildings is related to neighborhood and building characteristics. Prior research has shown that the over-building of residential parking leads to increased automobile ownership, vehicle miles traveled, and congestion. Parking availability can affect travel mode choices and decrease the use of transportation alternatives. In addition, zoning regulations requiring supplies of parking that exceed demand can increase housing costs and inhibit the development of mixed-use, mixed-income, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods. The primary research goal was to develop an empirical model for parking utilization in Washington, D.C., and to apply the model to an interactive web-based tool, named ParkRight DC, to support and guide parking supply decisions. A transparent, data-driven process for parking supply decisions may help relieve problems associated with over- or undersupply of parking. This paper outlines the data collection, model-development process, functionality of the resulting tool, and findings on key relationships and policy implications. The model and the associated tool rely on local information reflecting residential development and automobile ownership patterns drawn from a survey of multifamily residential parking use at 115 buildings covering approximately 20,000 dwelling units in the District of Columbia. The resulting model achieved an R2-value of .835, which indicates a strong model, given the complexity of the relationship being researched. © 2016, National Research Council. All rights reserved.},

To date, parking pricing is considered as an efficient tool for improving parking management by moderating parking demand. Hence, this paper proposes a parking charging method involving both the parking demand and supply. We aggregate the individual parking behaviors into the parking demand and consider the trade-offs between multiple parking behaviors. Then, a maximization problem is formulated to fulfill the benefits of parking demand as well as stabilizing parking supply. The results of case study indicate that the share of parking patterns has shifted positively, and an increment in the total benefit of respondents (5.00\%) is obtained. Considering parking dynamics, the proposed method can serve as an effective and feasible manner to equilibrate spatial and temporal distribution of parking demand thereby alleviating parking pressure.

	volume = {45},
	abstract = {The sharp contradiction between the rapidly growing number of vehicles and limited on-street parking space has resulted in the phenomenon of "difficult and disorderly parking", which has adverse impacts on performance of urban roads. Propensity towards usage of private vehicles coupled with ineffective public transport has led to unmanageable demand for parking, especially in CBD with observance of illegal parking every day. In order to formulate enforcement measures to reduce occupancy of illegal parking, it becomes imperative to investigate behavioural aspects associated with illegal parking. To comprehend this objective, two busy urban streets in CBD area of Surat city were selected for comparative assessment of legal and illegal parking demand. Preliminary, on-street parking inventory was carried out by licence plate method at 1 h interval during business hours to determine peak parking hours. The survey observed dominancy of two wheel-motorized vehicles on both sides for both roads, and hence all analyses were carried out in terms of two wheel-motorized vehicles. Microscopic parking inventory was then carried for both legal and illegal parking demands at 10 min data monitoring interval using licence plate survey method during peak parking hours. Statistical check on demand accumulation revealed significant difference in legal and illegal parking demand. To probe further, microscopic behavioural analysis was carried by obtaining percentage repetition of parked vehicles (PRPVs) between two successive sets of observations for different data monitoring intervals. Paired t-test at 5\% significance level between legal and illegal PRV values for different data monitoring intervals revealed isotropic behaviour between legal and illegal parking regimes. Further, efficient utilization of the available parking space in terms of turnover in 2 W per hour was analysed for each data frequency which indicated high value for high data frequency and vice versa. However, efficiency in terms of turnover was varying for both the demands with poor value for illegal parking. Research suggests that illegal problem in Surat city is a behavioural problem, and henceforth, stringent enforcement measures need to be formulated to reduce its occupancy. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	url = {https://www.racfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/spaced_out-bates_leibling-jul12.pdf},
	abstract = {Given the predominant role of the car in the nation’s transport, and the fact that almost every car journey requires a parking space at each end, the relatively
slight attention paid to parking in planning policy is perhaps surprising. The average car spends about 80\% of the time parked at home, is parked
elsewhere for about 16\% of the time, and is thus only actually in use (i.e. moving) for the remaining 3–4\% of the time. 
This report seeks to update a previous report on parking by the RAC Foundation published in 2004, and it includes a substantial and novel analysis
of the National Travel Survey (NTS) to give an overall impression of the demand for parking.
One important consequence of this lack of attention to parking is the consequent lack of data, particularly as it relates to parking supply. For residential parking, a reasonable overall picture can be obtained from the
English Housing Survey (EHS) undertaken by the Department for Communities and Local Government (and the corresponding survey for Scotland, ‘the Scottish House Condition Survey’). Local authorities do not have the resources or motivation to carry out adequate audits of available on- and off-street capacity except in small areas, such as for the installation of a local parking zone. While much of parking control has to be at a local level, there is still a need to understand the overall picture. Local authorities are required to submit certain financial information about their parking income and expenditure, but its accuracy is uncertain. In addition, while local authorities are also strongly advised to produce an annual parking report showing their resources and policies, only a small proportion of the nearly 300 Local Authorities who have powers under the Traffic Management Act 2004 to enforce parking regulations produces a full and easily accessible report.
Section 2 discusses these data issues and shows that, even in London, where parking issues are potentially most serious and where more research has been undertaken than elsewhere in Great Britain, obtaining an up-to-date assessment of parking supply is difficult, and the survey techniques are expensive. From the aforementioned housing surveys, it may be concluded that although the number of dwellings in Great Britain has been increasing by about 0.2 million per year, the number of garages has remained constant: thissuggests that garages in older dwellings are being converted to living rooms or other storage, and that cars are increasingly kept in the open. 
The analysis of the NTS data, presented in Section 3, is divided into residential parking and destination parking. It shows how the type of residential parking used (garage, on-street, etc.) varies strongly with housing type and residential
density. Overall, 25\% of vehicles are parked on-street overnight, but this rises to 60\% at the highest densities. For destination parking, nearly 70\% of all parking acts are for less than 3 hours, and nearly 90\% are for less than 8.5 hours. In spite of most parking acts being of short duration, the pattern is dominated by workplace parking, for three reasons:
a. travel to work is the most frequent reason for parking (outside London,70\% of people commute by car);
b. with the minor exception of holiday parking, workplace parking has the greatest duration; and
c. the starting time is more concentrated than that for other purpose.
The highest overall demand for parking spaces is at 12 p.m., when the non-workplace parking demands add about 44\% to the base demand due to workplace parking. 
The breakdown of parking acts by purpose actually varies very little by type of area. But purpose is strongly associated with different kinds of parking location, public car parks being especially used by shoppers and those travelling for social and recreational activities, while most people travelling to work by car use company car parks. In terms of the charges people pay for parking, it is noteworthy that according to the NTS, for 94\% of all destination parking acts there is no charge. Of the remaining 6\% that do pay something, over 82\% pay less than £3, and almost half pay less than £1. Overall, the analysis suggests that, excluding any charges for residential parking, the average annual parking cost is about £42 per vehicle, and, with an average of 1.14 cars per household, this translates to about £47 per household per year. These figures are in line with other sources, and show that despite the outcry in the local press which has often accompanied the introduction of residents’ parking charges, or changes in fees for local authority car parks, the average parking costs cannot be
considered significant. By contrast the amount spent on fuel alone is about £1,600 per vehicle.

Section 4 discusses in some detail how local authorities deal with parking, including within its scope the finances and the issue of parking tickets. After summarising the history of parking legislation and the Policy Paper resulting from the recent Department for Transport (DfT)’s traffic signs policy review (the so-called ‘signs and lines’ review), Signing the Way (DfT, 2011d), it presents an account of local authority attitudes to parking policy and how the legislation works in practice. In 2009/10, 7.1 million on-street penalty charge notices (PCNs) were issued, with a further 1.8 million tickets for off-street parking. In terms of council finances, London boroughs make most of their current parking account surplus from on-street parking, the total surplus amounting to 33\% of their parking income. Outside London, the corresponding proportion is 39\%, over 80\% of which is derived from off-street parking. However, when capital charges, largely for off-street car parks, are offset against this surplus, it is reduced to 19\% of income. In any case, these surpluses are small in relation
to overall revenue expenditure: in London the £180 million total parking surplus of all the London boroughs combined is only some 20\% higher than the amount raised by the central area congestion charge. Of the total income from on-street parking in London, half comes from parking fees and permits and half from penalties. Outside London, the ratio is around 55:45 (fees/permits:penalties). 
Section 5 reviews the main results of a survey by the DfT in 2009 about parking, a rare example of a survey of public attitudes to parking. Despite the widespread view that parking restrictions are considered oppressive and unfair, two thirds (65\%) of people with parking restrictions in their local area said that they thought there were about the right number of restrictions, 22\% thought there were too many and 13\% thought there were too few. Most people (60\%) also thought that the level of enforcement was about right, with the rest equally divided between those who said it was too rigid and those who said it was too lenient.
Section 6 reviews a number of recent developments in the administration, information and organisation of parking, especially those associated with new technology. It also picks up a number of other issues which are dealt with only cursorily in the report – including park-and-ride, and facilities for vehicles other than cars.
Section 7 then discusses the general effect of the provision of residential parking on car ownership, and the particular issue of standards for new developments. This is an area which needs more research. There is also a brief section on destination parking standards.
The report concludes with a general assessment of the issues under a number of key headings:
Information about parking resources
Environmental effects
Effect of parking supply on car ownership (and car use)
Provision for new dwellings
Pricing policy
Compliance and the control of parking
Ease of use
Other vehicles
There is a plea for a more ‘economic’ approach to pricing for parking, largely to ensure good use and provision of capacity. At the same time, it is recognised that there is a significant need for quality improvements, especially in information and convenience of payment. These two policies need to go hand in hand. The two appendices review the progress made, both in terms of research and policy implementation, with respect to the recommendations made in the 2004 report},

	title = {Architectural styles and the design of network-based software architectures},
	abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},

	abstract = {As decision-makers increasingly embrace life-cycle assessment (LCA) and target transportation services for regional environmental goals, it becomes imperative that outcomes from changes to transportation infrastructure systems are accurately estimated. Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction policies have created interest in better understanding how public transit systems reduce emissions. Yet the use of average emission factors (e.g., grams CO2e per distance traveled) persists as the state-of-the-art masking the variations in emissions across time, and confounding the ability to accurately estimate the environmental effects from changes to transit infrastructure and travel behavior. An LCA is developed of the Expo light rail line and a competing car trip (in Los Angeles, California) that includes vehicle, infrastructure, and energy production processes, in addition to propulsion. When results are normalized per passenger kilometer traveled (PKT), life-cycle processes increase energy use and GHG emissions up to 83\%, and up to 690\% for smog and respiratory impact potentials. However, the use of a time-independent PKT normalization obfuscates a decision-maker’s ability to understand whether the deployment of a transit system reduces emissions below a future year policy target (e.g., 80\% of 1990 emissions by 2050). The year-by-year marginal effects of the decision to deploy the Expo line are developed including reductions in automobile travel. The time-based marginal results provide clearer explanations for how environmental effects in a region change and the critical life-cycle processes that should be targeted to achieve policy targets. It shows when environmental impacts payback and how much reduction is achieved by a policy-specified future year.},

	abstract = {A smart camera is a vision system capable of extracting application-specific information from the captured images. The paper proposes a decentralized and efficient solution for visual parking lot occupancy detection based on a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically designed for smart cameras. This solution is compared with state-of-the-art approaches using two visual datasets: PKLot, already existing in literature, and CNRPark-EXT. The former is an existing dataset, that allowed us to exhaustively compare with previous works. The latter dataset has been created in the context of this research, accumulating data across various seasons of the year, to test our approach in particularly challenging situations, exhibiting occlusions, and diverse and difficult viewpoints. This dataset is public available to the scientific community and is another contribution of our research. Our experiments show that our solution outperforms and generalizes the best performing approaches on both datasets. The performance of our proposed CNN architecture on the parking lot occupancy detection task, is comparable to the well-known AlexNet, which is three orders of magnitude larger.},

	abstract = {Par sa Politique de stationnement, la Ville de Montréal veut faire du stationnement un outil de gestion stratégique répondant à ses orientations en matière de mobilité durable, d’aménagement du territoire et de développement économique. Elle veut également mettre les citoyens au cœur des priorités. 

Le stationnement est un domaine complexe et d’une grande sensibilité. S’y attaquer entraîne inévitablement des réactions émotives de la part d’une foule d’acteurs concernés puisque, dans bien des cas, des intérêts divergents sont mis en lumière. 

Au fil des ans, diverses solutions ont été implantées. Certaines de ces solutions présentent un réel intérêt, alors que d’autres ont suscité de vives critiques. Par le passé, le stationnement n’a pas fait l’objet d’une planification globale. Sauf exception, les exercices de planification ont davantage été réalisés à petite échelle. 

Avec les années et en tenant compte de l’évolution des préoccupations en matière d’environnement et de qualité de vie, une révision en profondeur de la gestion du stationnement est devenue essentielle. En effet, les pressions se sont accentuées sur le stationnement en milieu urbain. La croissance soutenue du parc automobile, le renouveau démographique observé dans les quartiers denses, la compétitivité des artères commerçantes, l’adhésion de plus en plus marquée de la population à la mobilité durable et à un partage mieux équilibré du domaine public sont autant de facteurs qui militent en faveur d’une révision du rôle du stationnement dans l’environnement urbain. À cela s’ajoutent l’abondance de la signalisation et du morcellement de la gestion administrative du stationnement qui sont devenues une source de frustration pour les citoyens et les commerçants.
La vision de la Politique de stationnement consiste à : 

Assurer une offre équilibrée en stationnement afin d’améliorer la qualité de vie des citoyens et d’assurer la vitalité économique, tout en réduisant la dépendance à l’automobile et son impact sur l’environnement. 

L’équilibre recherché vise à s’assurer que les besoins des citoyens ont été pris en considération, sans pour autant accroître la quantité de places de stationnement au point d’encourager les gens à délaisser les transports actifs et collectifs.

Dans le cadre de l’élaboration de cette politique, un portrait et un diagnostic ont été réalisés. Ils ont permis d’établir de grands constats, à savoir que pour la plupart des arrondissements, le stationnement sur rue constitue l’essentiel de l’offre, alors que les places tarifées sont principalement concentrées dans le centre de l’île, notamment sur les artères commerçantes.

Malgré l’existence de stationnements sur rue réservés aux résidents (SRRR), le stationnement pour les résidents est difficile dans les quartiers multifonctionnels plus denses, regroupant des commerces et des pôles d’emplois.

Au centre-ville, les places tarifées sur rue sont souvent occupées à plus de 85 \%, et ce, au-delà des périodes tarifées. La signalisation est devenue très complexe dans certains cas. En moyenne, nous trouvons 1,29 panneau par poteau, mais il arrive qu’un poteau compte jusqu’à six panneaux.
Pour ce qui est du stationnement hors rue au centre-ville, qui représente plus de 75 \% de l’offre totale, il est contrôlé par le secteur privé à près de 99 \%, ce qui empêche le développement d’une stratégie tarifaire favorisant la rotation et, par conséquent, l’utilisation des places de stationnement par un plus grand
nombre d’usagers.
Le portrait et le diagnostic qui ont été produits ont également abordé les exigences réglementaires en matière de stationnement, le partage des compétences et la gouvernance.

La vision de la Politique de stationnement illustre la complexité du stationnement dans le système de transport d’une ville. Elle tient compte de la diversité des secteurs, de la différence des besoins des usagers et de la multitude d’acteurs en présence, tant privés que publics. La politique aborde donc le stationne
ment comme un élément déterminant du plan de mobilité en voie d’élaboration. Elle s’appuie sur quatre principes directeurs :
Ces principes directeurs visent à répondre aux différents besoins en stationnement des résidents, des navetteurs, des visiteurs et des consommateurs, sans oublier les activités de livraison.
 
Principes directeurs
1 Simplifier et harmoniser les pratiques municipales afin d’assurer une meilleure cohérence de la gestion du stationnement.
2 Moduler le stationnement en fonction de l’offre en transports collectifs et actifs et des caractéristiques locales, notamment la densité de population et le volume d’emplois.
3 Optimiser le stationnement au centre-ville et sur les artères commerçantes afin de favoriser la vitalité économique.
4 Satisfaire les besoins des résidents dans les secteurs denses afin d’offrir un véritable choix en ce qui concerne les modes de transport collectif et actif.

Bénéficiant d’une meilleure connaissance de l’état du stationnement à Montréal, basée sur une vision claire et des principes directeurs, la Politique de stationnement s’articule autour de six stratégies :
La gestion stratégique du stationnement passe inévitablement par une révision du rôle des différents acteurs municipaux concernés, car le morcellement actuel des responsabilités entraîne des iniquités au sein même de la ville. L’idée n’est certes pas de proposer des solutions uniformes à l’échelle de la ville afin de respecter les caractéristiques des différents milieux en présence. Cependant, il va de soi que certaines pratiques gagneront à être mieux encadrées.
Ces stratégies cherchent à satisfaire les besoins des différentes clientèles, tout en respectant la vision du Plan de transport et des différents documents stratégiques adoptés par la Ville et l’agglomération, notamment le Schéma d’aménagement et de développement de l’agglomération de Montréal, le Plan d’urbanisme et le Plan stratégique de développement durable de la communauté montréalaise. Elles impliquent le déploiement de plusieurs mesures bien concrètes qui s’échelonneront dans le temps. 
Toutefois, Montréal s’engage à mettre en œuvre prioritairement les actions suivantes :
La gestion stratégique du stationnement passe inévitablement par une révision du rôle des différents acteurs concernés au sein de l’administration municipale, car le morcellement actuel des responsabilités entraîne des iniquités au sein même de la Ville.
Stratégies
1 Migrer vers le stationnement intelligent.
2 Créer un environnement propice au déploiement d’une mobilité plus durable.
3 Arrimer la gestion du stationnement aux objectifs de mise en valeur du territoire.
4 Mettre en place une nouvelle approche tarifaire.
5 Réviser l’encadrement réglementaire.
6 Revoir la gouvernance et la gestion des activités.

Actions prioritaires
1 La simplification et l’harmonisation des pratiques municipales de gestion et de tarification du stationnement.
2 La création d’un organisme municipal de gestion du stationnement.

	abstract = {1.0 INTRODUCTION
The specifications of this assignment required Stantec to assess four regional growth scenarios for HRM. The first scenario was to reflect Regional Municipal Planning Strategy goals for growth in designated urban (Regional Centre), suburban, and rural portions of the region. The second was to reflect continuation of recent trends that have fallen short of the RMPS goals. The third and fourth were to reflect stronger regional goals emphasizing greater concentration of growth in the core of the region. Stantec and its partners, Gardner Pinfold Consultants, were responsible to determine and compare public, private, and social costs and benefits anticipated from these scenarios over the period from 2011 to 2031. Stantec has also woven an assessment of the health impacts of alternative scenarios through the study to identify qualitative outcomes identifiable through the analysis of individual services. The report sets out a framework for Health Impact Assessment for the purpose and follows it to the conclusion of the study.
2.0 SETTLEMENT IN HRM
Population in the area now defined as HRM has shifted erratically since the founding of Halifax in the mid-eighteenth century. Since the 1950s the trend has been strongly toward dispersion of residential population from the urban core. Today, HRM as a whole is one of the most dispersed urban areas in North America, when measured by overall population density within its municipal boundaries. A closer look at the Regional Centre and Suburban Area is more encouraging, as the Regional Centre, in particular, shows high levels of sustainable transportation use. Population quickly dissipates away from the core, however, and costs relative to comparable urban areas in Canada are evident in measures of network length for roadways, and water and wastewater networks servicing the existing Regional Centre and Suburban Area, as opposed to the rural portion of the region.
3.0 SCENARIO CREATION
Altus Economic Consulting prepared comprehensive population, household, and labour force projections for HRM in 2004 that were updated in 2009. Stantec has employed these projections, with adjustments as necessary to account for trends apparent in recently released 2011 Census data. Housing unit additions by type calculated to 2031 based on the Altus projections have been distributed within the Regional Centre, and Suburban and Rural Areas of the region using land suitability assessment in GIS, assigning new housing units progressively to areas defined as most desirable/suitable by the GIS model. Related employment estimates were created by HRM staff using methods developed in the VISUM transportation model employed to assess impacts on the region’s transportation network.
4.0 TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
There is a complex two-way relationship between road improvements and regional development patterns. Together with other factors, expanded regional roadways facilitate dispersed development, which in turn generates demand for further road capacity both at the regional and local level. This study addresses the latter aspect of this relationship in terms of the influence of development on transportation.
The local road network must be extended with residential development in new areas of HRM. At the same time, additional residential development, depending on its scale and location influences use of the existing road network to degrees that may require strategic improvements. The distribution of development, furthermore, may influence the choice of mode of transportation, the vehicle trips required, and the time required for travel by citizens within the region. Stantec has quantified each of these factors for the four distribution scenarios to assess the influence of development patterns on the cost of transportation in the region.
5.0 WATER AND WASTEWATER SERVICES
Municipal networks for water distribution, as well as for collection and disposal of wastewater and stormwater are normally extended in association with new roads constructed in the Regional Centre and Suburban Area of HRM. In the Rural Area, piped networks are not provided as homes rely on wells and onsite septic disposal, with less expensive ditch and culvert systems for stormwater collection. Stantec has assessed the cost of developing the required systems in each area of HRM and the overall cost of their development
for all of HRM.
6.0 OTHER PUBLIC SERVICES
A wide variety of services is provided to citizens through specialized facilities provided by the Municipality and the Province. While the form of facilities and the interaction between them and the citizens they serve varies considerably, their efficiency and adequacy is strongly associated with the distance between facilities and the public. For each distinct service provided, Stantec has calculated the cumulative distance between existing facilities and the new residential development distributed as assumed for each distribution scenario. We have also assessed the future adequacy of several facility networks to determine the potential need for new facilities under future distribution patterns.
7.0 PRIVATE UTILITIES
Several important networked systems are provided to HRM citizens by private companies. Stantec assessed the extension of electricity, telecommunications, and natural gas networks to determine their cost under each distribution scenario. In the case of natural gas, which is being supplied within a limited area of the municipality, Stantec also assessed the potential extent of the future network so as to provide a basis for further estimation of its environmental benefits.
8.0 SUMMARY OF SERVICE IMPACTS
Results of our analysis clearly show the benefits of concentrating new residential development. For nearly all services assessed, the best distribution scenario is Scenario B in which the maximum proportion (50 per cent) of new development is located in the Regional Centre. Of 26 measures ranked, Scenario B provides the best outcome for 22. The scenario ranks second in terms of increased transit use and obtains mixed results in terms of elementary and junior high school enrolment balance. It would however create the most stress on parkland supply of any scenario. Scenario A, which allocates 40 per cent of new development to the Regional Centre, generally ranks second, although it ranks ahead of Scenario B in terms of its positive impact on transit use. The current RMPS objective of locating 25 per cent of new residential development in the Regional Centre with 50 per cent in the Suburban Area and 25 per cent in the Rural Area generally ranks third with exceptions being water and wastewater improvements for which costs would be highest, school over and under enrolment, where it is at least tied for the best outcome for all three levels of schooling, and in terms of increased transit usage, in which it ranks very slightly behind the Trend Scenario, partly because achievement of the RMPS Goals would encourage more use of active transportation modes. Continuation of the current trend by which only 16 per cent of new residential development has located in the Regional Centre provides the worst outcome in all cases except for transit usage, where it shows 0.1 per cent edge over the RMPS Scenario, and travel time to the Materials Recycling Facility, where it ties the RMPS scenario.
9.0 ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC AND HEALTH IMPACTS
Assessment of GHG emissions suggests that concentration of development will reduce locally generated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to a small degree. Economic assessment of costs to provide and maintain more extensive infrastructure, if sprawl is permitted to continue and for users to employ this infrastructure, suggests very substantial savings available. Between continuation of the current pattern of sprawl and the RMPS Goals, Gardner Pinfold has calculated nearly \$700 million in savings can be achieved.
Taking into account the densest alternative considered for this study (Scenario B), modelling suggests more than \$3 billion in reduced costs. Health impacts were assessed qualitatively and Stantec has concluded that more condensed scenarios provide superior outcomes for six of nine factors considered to be related to community health. Evidence is ambivalent for the other three factors but does not alter the overall conclusions of this study},

	abstract = {This study documents the costs of providing infrastructure and services to different residential densities. It is an accessible, informational resource to inform municipal planning initiatives and regional growth policies pertaining to different densities and forms of residential development, such as ‘infill’ and
‘greenfield’.
This study summarizes available references, case studies, best practices, and informational interviews, and is focused on findings and implications most relevant to the Metro Vancouver region. It is based on a literature review of available publications and informational interviews with leading practitioners and
academics.
KEY CONSIDERATIONS
The following should be considered when making land use and urban form decisions, as well as those associated with public infrastructure investments to support desired forms of residential land uses and densities, and when reviewing property tax and utility fee policies:
- It is critical to permit and facilitate higher density and more cost-effective forms of development in urban / developed areas (i.e., infill, intensification, redevelopment), where public infrastructure investments can be best utilized. Where regulatory barriers exist to urban densification in such locations, consider a review of policies and regulations and discourage developments that are not compact form, mixed-use, and that cannot be cost-efficiently serviced.
- Achieving compact, complete communities does not necessarily require extremely high density development forms. Optimum densities are a factor of context, and are often a combination of densities and uses that result in more livable, sustainable, and balanced communities. For example, moving from low density to medium densities in urban centres and along transit corridors can provide significant improvements in infrastructure servicing cost outcomes.
- The costs of infrastructure and utility provision should be set to better reflect actual service costs
and charge those who directly benefit:
   - The use of metering for utilities should be considered, where possible, such as for water and sewerage; with new and emerging technologies, such as improved metering, user fees can be more precise and effective, and managed electronically.
     - Utility fees should not be focused simply on raising revenues, but also on changing behaviours and outcomes. Fees and incentives can be set and adjusted to encourage desired actions and choices and meet community buildings objectives.
-Applying Development Cost Charges that vary by residential unit type / size / density as well as subarea geography, better reflects the actual costs of servicing demand.
-Closely coordinating and integrating land use planning, engineered infrastructure, asset management, and municipal financial decision-making including full lifecycle costing, leads to improved land use and financial outcomes

SUMMARY FINDINGS OF THE STUDY
Literature Review
 ‘Urban sprawl’ refers to dispersed, segregated (single-use), automobile-oriented, urban-fringe
development, while ‘Smart Growth’ comprises more compact, mixed-use, multi-modal forms of
development. Some, but not all, public services are sensitive to a city’s development patterns and
residential densities.
 More compact development forms tend to reduce infrastructure costs on a per capita basis, support
more efficient use of resources, and encourage more sustainable forms of transportation. However,
the relationships between residential densities and public costs are complex; actual costs depend on
the specific services and conditions, and local context.
 Higher density development forms are associated with lower per capita municipal expenditures for
streets and highways, sewer, water, and solid waste.
 While property taxes are for general municipal services and are calculated on assessed property
values, a user fee, such as for utilities, is a charge for consuming a municipally provided good or
service.
 User fees are a ‘cost-recovery revenue tool’ and must be set based on the costs of providing the
good or service to the user.
Case Studies
-The case studies generally indicate that the infrastructure servicing costs per dwelling unit declines as residential densities increase.
-This is largely associated with reduced linear infrastructure (i.e., roads, water pipes, sewer lines) per capita for higher density, compact design and development forms, as compared to lower density forms.
-However, large urban infill projects still require significant infrastructure investments. Other costs, such as labour-intensive services (rather than capital-intensive infrastructure), are more directly related to population levels and incurred on a per capita basis.
-Thus, the relationship between residential density and municipal costs is nuanced, and also can be impacted by local matters, such as the condition (age, capacity) of infrastructure and other physical elements such as geography and topography.
Infrastructure Servicing Costs
- The costs for onsite infrastructure / servicing for house vs. apartment developments are approximately five to nine times more expensive on a per capita basis (\$13,000 vs. \$2,000) and on a per unit basis (\$40,000 vs. \$5,000), respectively.
-This illustrates the greater cost effectiveness of higher density and multi-unit residential development forms can be as compared to lower density, single-detached development, because the infrastructure costs can be apportioned to more units.
-As most of these infrastructure costs are initially borne by a developer and ultimately the resident,
lower infrastructure costs can help contribute to lower housing costs.
Furthermore, after construction and development, the cost of maintaining the infrastructure is
typically the responsibility of the municipality and ultimately taxpayers, therefore more efficient
infrastructure systems can reduce public operating costs and fees / taxes over the long term.
Development Cost Charges
-Development Cost Charges (DCCs) in British Columbia are enabled under provincial legislation to pay for new or expanded infrastructure (sewer, water, drainage, parks, and roads) necessary to adequately service the demands of new development.
- In Metro Vancouver, the municipal DCC rates per unit are almost always highest for single-detached houses (up to \$40,000 to \$60,000), lowest for apartment units (approximately \$10,000), and in between for townhouses.
- However, when adjusted for the typical number of residents in a household, which varies by unit type, the range of per capita DCC rates vary only by a few thousand dollars, averaging: \$9,000 per apartment resident, \$10,000 per townhouse resident, and \$11,000 per house resident.
- The DCC rates by unit type can vary considerably by municipality, yet within individual municipalities generally do not vary. While allowable under provincial legislation, most municipalities do not charge different DCC rates for different sub-areas or catchment areas.
Municipal Expenditures Analysis
-Based on a review of current municipal budgets in the region, approximately one-third of expenditures (i.e., both capital and operating costs) are related to utilities / engineering services that could be impacted to some degree by land uses, development forms, and densities, and associated infrastructure requirements with the balance (approximately two-thirds), being unrelated.
-The balance of municipal costs (operating and capital) are for various types of ‘soft’ services that are generally labour-intensive and more a function of population than density.
- While there are potential municipal cost savings associated with more compact forms of development, the scale of this possible amount should be considered within the overall municipal context.
Property Taxes and Utility Fees
-Property taxes are a function of the assessed value of a property, with municipal tax rates set by the host municipality. Nearly half of the property taxes collected go to other levels of government than the local municipality, such as to the provincial government and other agencies.
-Municipal utility fees for such services as water, sewage, and garbage, may also apply.
-On average in Metro Vancouver, detached houses pay \$5,600 in property taxes; the amounts are lower for townhouses (\$3,000) and apartments (\$2,100).
-These amounts vary by municipality as the mill rates vary by jurisdiction, and also vary within municipalities depending on the assessed values of properties. Of the total taxes and fees paid by typical households, a quarter to a third of that amount goes to utility fees

Methodological Complexities
-Defining, calculating, and attributing costs and revenues for different services by different asset classes or unit types can be a data and methodological challenge.
-Conceptually, there are four categories: infrastructure (capital) costs and revenues, and service (operating) costs and revenues.
-Some of these may be paid for by a developer as one-time charges during construction, be it through providing the infrastructure and / or paying DCCs, and some by residents in the form of ongoing property taxes and utility fees.
- Some practical challenges for such calculations are defining ‘urban’ or ‘suburban’ development forms / densities for data collection and reporting purposes, and potentially attributing some costs and revenues to other non-residential land uses (such as commercial and industrial).
- Many municipal services and associated costs are more a function of residential population level rather than housing density, and some services, such as capital-intensive infrastructure can benefit from economies of scale, while labour-intensive services do not.
-There are also significant local considerations and contextual issues. Some municipal costs may be higher on an absolute basis in a high-density, established urban location because of ‘urban harshness’ and increased complexities, but lower on a per unit or per capita basis because of the greater development densities.
-Given these complexities and limitations, the expectations about the resulting values should beunderstood as high-level or estimates.},

	abstract = {To promote land-efficient development that supports nonautomobile modes of transportation, many municipalities are trying to implement parking policies that minimize parking oversupply and use existing parking supply more effectively. A commonly proposed strategy is for municipalities to lower their minimum parking standards. However, parking supply decisions are based on many factors, and experience shows that reducing parking standards does not always lead to corresponding reductions in parking supply. Using the results of an extensive commercial parking survey conducted across the City of Toronto, Canada, this study develops an empirical approach to determine whether reductions in parking standards are likely to lead to reductions in the amount of parking supplied by new development. It is proposed that the proportion of existing sites supplying less parking than existing standards require can be used as an indicator of the likelihood of developers to respond to reductions in parking standards by providing less parking. This assumes that the development characteristics of surveyed sites can be considered representative of current development practices. Applying such an analysis to Toronto, it is expected that reducing the parking standards for general office, medical office, and general retail uses will be a successful strategy in encouraging new development to provide fewer parking spaces on average. Such a strategy will be less successful for bank and large grocery uses, which tend to provide more parking and are less sensitive to minimum parking standards.},

Taking a neo-classical economic approach would lead parking policies in one direction, but allowing for transactions costs, hysteresis, second-best factors, game-playing, etc. as well as normative concerns over equity of various kinds, all of which reflect institutional structures, can lead into a variety of others.

	abstract = {Parking minimums have been criticized for requiring developers to build more parking than they would without regulation; however, to date, few studies have explored why there might be variation in how much parking is built or why developers might willingly build parking above the minimums. To answer these questions, I assembled a sample of residential and mixed-use developments approved for construction in Los Angeles between 2013 and 2018 and analyzed if any development or neighborhood characteristics predicted parking above the minimum. I also interviewed 11 developers and real-estate professionals about parking minimums. I found that parking minimums are binding except when they are smallest: developments generally provided about as much parking as they were required to do even as the amount of parking they were required to provide decreased. Only developments with the largest parking minimum reductions built significantly more parking than required. Additionally, developments were more likely to provide extra parking when located in denser neighborhoods where people are least likely to drive and most likely to travel by public transit or by foot. These neighborhoods have less preexisting parking, and developers are likely incentivized to capitalize on this shortage to build more parking. Finally, I found that market-rate developers build more parking in response to perceived market demand, pressure from financial lenders, and neighborhood opposition. Affordable housing developers, however, try to minimize the amount of parking built to ensure financial efficiency and build less parking overall.},

	abstract = {Parking requirements are an important part of urban planning. Parking influences a number of
behaviours and measures relevant to planning, including mode choice, density, urban form and
housing affordability. Much research on parking has taken place in American cities which have
different demographic, regulatory, and transportation contexts than Canadian ones. This
research is an examination of off-street parking requirements in Canadian cities. It focuses on
parking standards for multi-unit residential buildings, explores different approaches used in this
regulatory practice and sheds light on the ways in which Canadian cities are dealing with
parking requirements today. This is done through a scan of parking requirements across the 30
largest cities in the country, the detailed analysis of parking policies and of their objectives in
four cities, and interviews with professionals in Toronto and Vancouver on the political,
economic and institutional forces that have shaped their city’s parking regulations. Findings
suggest that large Canadian cities are facing pressure to better manage their parking systems,
leading to the development of new tools to regulate parking in increasingly sophisticated ways.
The paper concludes with recommendations for planners to consider when developing parking
requirements, cautions them about the ways in which such requirements can be misused, and
encourages them to continue to innovate and challenge accepted practices of parking
regulation.},

	abstract = {When the automobile was first introduced, few Americans predicted its fundamental impact, not only on how people would travel, but on the American landscape itself. Instead of reducing the amount of wheeled transport on public roads, the advent of mass-produced cars caused congestion, at the curb and in the right-of-way, from small midwestern farm towns to New York, Chicago, Detroit, and Los Angeles. Lots of Parking examines a neglected aspect of this rise of the automobile: the impact on America not of cars in motion but of cars at rest. While most studies have tended to focus on highway construction and engineering improvements to accommodate increasing flow and the desire for speed, John A. Jakle and Keith A. Sculle examine a fundamental feature of the urban, and suburban, scene--the parking lot. Their lively and exhaustive exploration traces the history of parking from the curbside to the rise of public and commercial parking lots and garages and the concomitant demolition of the old pedestrian-oriented urban infrastructure. In an accessible style enhanced by a range of interesting and unusual illustrations, Jakle and Sculle discuss the role of parking in downtown revitalization efforts and, by contrast, its role in the promotion of outlying suburban shopping districts and its incorporation into our neighborhoods and residences. Like Jakle and Sculle's earlier works on car culture, Lots of Parking will delight and fascinate professional planners, landscape designers, geographers, environmental historians, and interested citizens alike.

In three of these cities, parking supply increased significantly during the study period; in the other three cities parking supply increased only slightly. The main objective of this paper is to illustrate how these changes in parking supplies have affected the tax revenues in each city. An analysis based on geographic information systems was used to calculate the tax revenue of all properties in the study area of each city. Tax revenues generated from parking were quantified and were compared with tax revenues from nonparking uses on a proportional basis. Across the six cities, land occupied by surface parking contributed between 5\% and 17\% of the tax revenue that land occupied by taxable nonparking uses contributed. The analysis characterized an important concession involved in devoting large areas of land in the center of a city to surface parking.},

However, due to the difficulty in identifying the policy effect, few empirical studies have directly and accurately estimated the effects of parking standards on parking supply. The present study examines a parking reform in London, UK, where minimum parking standards for residential developments were replaced with maximum standards in the early 2000s. Using planning application records, we match neighboring pre-reform and post-reform developments to estimate the effect of the parking standard switch and further identify the "binding" and "capping" effects of minimum and maximum parking standards. It is found that the parking reform in London has led to a reduction of approximately 0.76 parking spaces per unit in residential development applications, or 49\% of the pre-reform level. Minimum parking standards seem to have a larger impact than maximum ones on parking supply that fell more upon inner city developments, while maximum parking standards have more influenced suburban neighborhoods. Market forces have played a major role in the decline of parking supply. The findings provide strong evidence for the market distortion effect of minimum parking standards. © 2014.},

However, there is little understanding of the adequacy of off-street car parking for individual apartment households. Drawing on a survey of apartment residents in Perth, Melbourne, and Sydney (n = 1316), this research assesses the adequacy of off-street car parking provision for apartment households and provides an understanding of factors associated with an undersupply and oversupply of off-street car parking. Results show that around two-thirds (65.9\%) of apartment households have a ‘balanced’ amount of off-street car parking, where the number of cars owned is equal to the number of allocated off-street car parking spaces. The remaining households either have an oversupply of off-street car parking (20.2\%) or an undersupply (14.0\%), almost always involving one parking space too many or one too few. Factors associated with an under/oversupply of off-street car parking are found to be largely related to household characteristics and residents' perceptions of parking issues. The findings highlight the potential for ‘unbundling’ off-street car parking from the purchase price or rental cost of apartment housing, while developing more tailored residential parking requirements that seek to prevent an under/oversupply of parking.},

Urban parking requirements are very precise and routinely enforced despite the fact that most cities have little to no knowledge about their own parking supply. To further explore these issues, a parking inventory for metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, USA is developed by cross-referencing geospatial cadastral and roadway data with minimum parking requirements. Metropolitan Phoenix is chosen because it is relatively young, rapidly growing, highly sprawled, and car dependent. Historical growth of parking is also estimated by linking year of property development to required off-street and nearby on-street parking spaces. As of 2017, we estimate that there were 12.2 million parking spaces in the metropolitan region with 4.04 million inhabitants, 2.86 million registered personal vehicles, and 1.84 million jobs. Growth of parking in metro Phoenix has also been significant; since 1960, 10.9 million spaces have been added to the region compared to a population growth of 3.41 million, vehicle fleet growth of 2.63 million, and employment growth of 1.56 million jobs. Since the 2008 recession, parking growth in metro Phoenix has significantly slowed, but continued urban growth combined with substantial minimum parking requirements may promote more parking infrastructure than is needed. Planners and policy makers should value quantifying the growth and supply of parking in urban areas and consider reforming parking standards to promote sustainable urban growth.},

However, public perception about parking availability often forces planning offices to recommend parking lot sizes that exceed daily demands. The recent trend of increasing the size of stores, churches and even schools comes with increasing the size of parking lots that service these buildings. The objective of this paper is to analyze space allocation of parking lots in a typical midwestern county and to estimate the supply of parking spaces to potential demand. We also estimate the loss of ecosystem services represented by the area of parking lots in this county. We found that parking lots cover 5.65km2 (1 397acres) of Tippecanoe County, Indiana which implies that 0.44\% of the county area is devoted to parking lots. Our results show that there are approximately 2.2 parking spaces per registered vehicle, that parking lots make up more than 6.57\% of the total urban footprint in this county, that the area of parking lots exceeded the area of parks in the city limits by a factor of three and that parking lot runoff and pollutants are significant compared to runoff and pollutants from these areas prior to their conversion to parking lots. As other authors have done before us we lament the poor use of land in urban regions of the United States, and encourage planners to think creatively about the use of land for parking.},

	title = {The 2018 {Regional} {Parking} {Study}},
	abstract = {The 2018 Regional Parking Study is the second regional-scale apartment parking study to be undertaken in the Metro Vancouver region. In a metropolitan area where six out of 10 new housing units built are in apartment buildings, the availability of timely data to inform appropriate apartment parking requirements is likely to continue. An excessive supply of parking represents an inefficient use of land and capital resources, especially in Urban Centres and areas along the Frequent Transit Network, and a missed opportunity to reflect evolving transportation choices and to reduce the cost of housing construction. The Regional Parking Study, a collaborative effort between TransLink and Metro Vancouver, draws out patterns to expand the knowledge base of practitioners and policymakers in member jurisdictions and the development community.
Many of the patterns are consistent with expectations and reflect the success that the region has had in coordinating land use and transportation decisions. The findings also reveal opportunities to ‘right size’ the amount of parking in apartment buildings for both motorized vehicles and bicycles, and highlight the opportunity to treat on-site and on-street parking as a system.
The findings of the 2018 Regional Parking Study largely corroborate those in the 2012 Apartment Parking Study, and includes new insights about street parking supply and utilization. Apartment parking supply remains excessive relative to observed utilization. Apartment buildings close to frequent transit, whether bus or SkyTrain, have lower parking supply and utilization. The lower rates of parking utilization areassociated with higher transit use as measured by the number of bus boardings near the buildings, and this relationship is stronger for rental apartment sites.
Street parking is inherently complex in mixed-use neighbourhoods. Some of the factors contributing to street parking use include visitors to non-residential land uses, such as restaurants, shops, and parks; apartment visitors on weekends, holidays, and special occasions; and some apartment residents parking on the street. Even with these factors, only a handful of surveyed street networks experienced persistently high street parking utilization.
Finally, the 2018 Regional Parking Study highlights a challenge that remains unchanged from the 2012 Study. The design and capacity of current bicycle parking facilities in apartment buildings are discouraging their use by many residents. Looking ahead, practitioners and policymakers should be mindful of evolving mobility choices, technology, and consumer preferences, and the potential implications for vehicle ownership, parking demand, and parking requirements in  apartment buildings, on streets, and in other building structures. TransLink and Metro Vancouver will continue to look for opportunities to undertake and support research related to parking in accordance to regional policies, and to support the efforts of member jurisdictions to coordinate land use and transportation decisions.},

	url = {https://assets.dmagstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/18806_Research_RIHA_Parking_Report-1.pdf},
	abstract = {Comprehensive parking inventories have never existed for U.S. cities. Because of this, many parking-related questions have never been answered. This uncertainty — not knowing how much parking there is near a site or in a city — is the motivation for this report. By presenting the first complete parking inventories for five U.S. cities, this research reveals an investment in parking that is out of balance with the current demand for parking in almost all cases, and even less in tune with what appears to be declining future demand.

This is not merely scientifically interesting, it also has great practical significance for planners, property developers, investors and lenders. It uncovers an opportunity to build more efficient cities that contain fewer unused parking spaces and more of everything else.  

Three trends make this research timely. First, transportation preferences are changing, especially in urban areas, and a smaller share of Americans drive today than in the recent past. Second, policymakers are starting to relax their parking minimums and in some cases replace them with parking maximums. Third, datasets related to parking are becoming more accessible.  

Exhaustive high-resolution parking inventories can identify parking shortages, and expose parking surpluses. These inventories can support developers who cannot afford to build extra parking at the expense of the other parts of their projects, or policymakers who are ready to relax minimum parking requirements for new construction, or who are concerned about spending public works money on free parking. Either way, the research presented here  suggests that future developments should provide fewer parking spaces than past developments. And today’s empty parking spaces can be seen as a land bank in some of the most convenient city locations.

The parking inventories developed in this paper for New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, Des Moines, and Jackson, Wyoming reveal a lavish amount of parking. Parking spaces outnumber homes 27 to one in Jackson. Seattle’s population density of 13 people per acre is less than half its parking density of 29 parking stalls per acre. Philadelphia’s parking density is 3.7 times greater than that of homes. Des Moines has 83,141 households and 1.6 million parking spaces. New York is the only city in the study with more homes than parking, an outcome partially explained by the greater provision of public transit. 

The parking inventories reveal monumental investments in parking. By calculating the median price of a square foot of land within each cell of a 500-meter hexagonal overlay, and making conservative assumptions about the construction costs of surface and structured parking, I am able to estimate the replacement cost of all of the parking in each city. This is explained in more detail in Appendix B. The 1.6 million parking spaces in Seattle’s inventory have an estimated value, or a “replacement cost,” of \$35.8 billion, which is \$118,000 per Seattle household. Jackson is home to over 100,000 parking spaces that would cost \$711 million to replace, or \$192,000 per household. The per household share of the parking inventory in Des Moines and Philadelphia is \$77,000 and \$30,000 respectively. New York’s per-household cost is \$6,570, a fraction of that of the other cities. 

The amount of parking varies widely within cities and between cities. There is no “normal” amount of parking, but New York stands out as unique. New York’s parking is worth \$20.6 billion, or \$15.2 billion less than Seattle’s, even though New York has a population 12 times greater than Seattle. Seattle’s per-household parking cost burden is 18 times greater than New York’s. 

Another difference between New York and the other inventoried cities is in the distribution of parking spaces across the map. The prominence of on-street parking in New York’s mixture of parking types as a smoothing effect on parking access that contrasts with uneven parking distributions in the other cities. For example, in Seattle, Des Moines, and Philadelphia, substantial investments in structured and off-street surface parking contributed to downtown areas with more than 100 parking spaces per acre, and surrounding areas having a fraction of that amount. 

The study also provides a description of the mixture of parking types which is further explored by using a decile analysis of land prices and parking supply. Where land is less expensive, here is more likely to be surface parking. And where land is more expensive, there is less likely to be surface parking. But what was surprising is that as land increases in price and surface parking begins to dissolve, the amount of parking in an area may still increase as parking spaces take shelter in new buildings. In a seeming paradox, parking is more pervasive where it is less visible. 

These parking inventories are all dependent on available data. Data availability is improving but the inconsistency of schemas across cities is challenging. On-street parking data were available from the transportation department of just one city, Seattle. New York street parking data came from combining signage data with streets, a task that required skills in computer programming and database architecture. For the other three cities, on-street parking inventories were derived from the geometries of street linework. Parcel data was publicly available for all five cities, but each tax assessor recorded parking differently, making off-street structured parking inventories a custom job for each city. Almost all of the off-street surface parking data came from satellite or aerial imagery, yet these data differed in resolution and kind for each city. Despite the source data inconsistencies, the method used to build parking inventories for the five cities in this study can also generate parking inventories for other cities in the future. These inventories are just a start, and many questions will need to be asked — and answered — in future research.},

ABSTRACT: Parking is the strongest link between car use and land use. However, it remains a relatively unstudied topic, even though it is a vital element in the management of urban mobility and accessibility. The main objective of this research is to develop analysis methods to study parking supply and use. More precisely, the following specific objectives are pursued :  Design of automated tools to analyze parking sign data of the city of Montréal, in order to study parking supply and how it varies in time and space.  Development of automated procedures to analyze parking utilization using trip data from the Origin-Destination (OD) survey.  Development of an information system integrating the supply estimations and the utilization behaviors derived from the OD survey. The first step of this project is to review past research conducted on parking. The review focuses on research made on parking utilization, as well as on parking management and on the many impacts of parking on travel behaviors, use of transportation systems and on the structure of cities.},

	abstract = {The San Francisco Bay Area (herein, the Bay Area) is one of the most progressive transportation regions in the deployment of high-capacity transit and use of policies to encourage active transportation. Yet like many other metro regions, there remains a dearth of knowledge on the abundance and location of parking infrastructure supply. Parking infrastructure remains one of the least catalogued infrastructure but is perhaps the most spatially dominating set of assets. The extent and location of parking supply, including on-street and off-street spaces, are estimated for the nine-county Bay Area. This parking space inventory is the most detailed assessment of parking infrastructure produced for the Bay Area, and represents an important starting point for addressing the impacts of and crafting policy for future transportation goals.
On-street and off-street spaces are estimated using different approaches. On-street spaces are estimated for largely local and collector roadways based on usable curb length removing un-parkable space associated with bus stations, intersections, bridges, tunnels, driveways, and fire hydrants. Spaces on each roadway link were assigned a residential or non-residential classification. Off-street spaces were estimated by joining a regional assessor database with municipal parking requirements. The corresponding county assessor databases were from the years 2020-2021. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission’s consolidated assessor database that levels the nine Bay Area counties with common land use codes was used. Parking requirements for 96 of the 101 municipalities in the Bay Area were identified (the remaining 5 were estimated as averages for other municipalities in the region). These requirements were largely from contemporary years, but two dated back to around 1990. The joining of the assessor databases and the requirements were largely based on bedrooms (residential) and building or parcel area (non-residential) although several exceptions (edge cases) had to be addressed.
These 1\% of parcels included land uses such as hospitals, schools, assembly places, universities, restaurants, stadiums, and multi-story structures. Manual counts of satellite images and supplementary data were often used to supplement or validate estimates. The results provide critical information for focusing policies and urban form changes aimed at affecting parking supply and demand towards reduced automobility. 
There are an estimated 15 million spaces in the region, 8.6 million on-street and 6.4 million off-street. End-to-end, Bay Area parking would stretch around the Earth 2.3 times. There are 1.9 spaces per person, 2.7 spaces per employed individual, and 2.4 spaces per auto and light-duty truck. Residential parking dominates the share of supply at 70\% and commercial at 9.4\%. Space density (spaces per acre) is highest in downtown San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose largely attributed to high-rise structures. On-street parking is dominant in the North Bay, commanding 78\% of total parking in Napa, 75\% in Solano, 68\% in Sonoma, and 67\% in Marin County. Pockets of dense off-street parking are seen throughout the Bay Area but tend to be concentrated in the more heavily urbanized areas along the East Bay and Peninsula subregions from San Francisco and Oakland south to San Jose. There are three census blocks where the parking area exceeds land area. However, at the building scale, there are over 3,200 non-residential and 780 residential parcels where parking area exceeds land area (out of a total of 2.1 million parcels).
Parking area constitutes 7.9\% of the total incorporated area. By comparison, less than 1\% of the region’s incorporated area can be characterized as dense, mixed-use areas that support walking and transit.1 Certain zoning practices can drive the share of parking up significantly. Commercial neighborhoods dominated by low-rise buildings with large surface lots have parking land area shares of 21-44\% of total land area, and stadiums with extensive surface lots can command 81\% of land area for parking. 
Comparing the Bay Area against Los Angeles and Phoenix provides helpful insights into the commitment, extent, and utilization of parking. The Bay Area with a population of 7.7 million people has less parking per person (1.9 spaces) than the Phoenix metro region (4.0 million people and 2.7 spaces per person) but the same as Los Angeles County (9.8 million people and 1.9 spaces per person). The Bay Area has 2.4 spaces per auto and light-duty truck, well below Phoenix metro (4.3) and Los Angeles County (3.3). It also outperforms on spaces per job at 2.7 (with Phoenix metro at 6.6 and Los Angeles County at 4.7). The
portion of paved surfaces taken up by parking in the Bay Area is significantly smaller than Phoenix Metro and Los Angeles County. Approximately 20\% of the incorporated area of the Bay Area is paved with parking (7.9\%) and roadways (12.4\%). This is roughly one-half that of the 36\% paved Phoenix metro (10\% parking, 26\% roadways) and the 41\% paved Los Angeles County (14\% parking, 27\% roadways)},

We focus on a method that estimates parking lot coverage over the four state region and use independent studies to estimate model parameters and validate our model. In total, we estimate that the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin allocate 1260km2 of their land to parking lots, with the lower bound of the estimate at 976km2 and the upper bound at 1745km2. This accounts for approximately 4.97\% of urban land use and over 43 million parking spaces whereas the number of adults over 18 years old in these four states amounted to just over 25 million. The estimated number of spaces per vehicle in each state ranges from 2.49 in Indiana to 2.95 in Michigan. Within the four states studied, states that had a higher proportion of their urban land devoted to parking lots were states where urban sprawl was more prevalent.},

Of particular importance is the characterization of the area fraction of various surface-types as well as the vegetative fraction. In this paper, a method is discussed for developing data on surface-type distribution and city-fabric (land cover) makeup (percentage of various surface-types) using high-resolution orthophtos. We devised a semi-automatic Monte Carlo method to sample the data and visually identify the surface-type for each pixel. The color aerial photographs for Sacramento covered a total of about 65km2, at 0.3-m resolution. Five major land-use types were examined: (1) downtown and city center, (2) industrial, (3) offices, (4) commercial, and (5) residential. In downtown Sacramento, the top view (above-the-canopy) shows that vegetation covers 30\% of the area, whereas roofs cover 23\% and paved surfaces (roads, parking areas, and sidewalks) 41\%. In the industrial areas, vegetation covers 8–14\% of the area, whereas roofs cover 19–23\%, and paved surfaces 29–44\%. The surface-type percentages in the office area were 21\% trees, 16\% roofs, and 49\% paved areas. In commercial areas, vegetation covers 5–20\%, roofs 19–20\%, paved surfaces 44–68\%. Residential areas exhibit a wide range of percentages among their various surface-types. On average, vegetation covers about 36\% of the area, roofs about 20\%, and paved surfaces about 28\%.

In residential areas, on average, paved surfaces cover about 35\% of the area. Land-use/land cover (LULC) data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) was used to extrapolate these results from neighborhood scales to metropolitan Sacramento. Of an area of roughly 800km2, defining most urban areas of the metropolitan Sacramento, about half is residential. The total roof area comprises about 150km2 and the total paved surfaces (roads, parking areas, sidewalks) are about 310km2. The total vegetated area covers about 230km2.

Literature states that when transport infrastructure takes a significant plot of land, the boundaries of the occupied area tend to expand, and new areas are impacted by the settlements. As a consequence, more investments are necessary to provide urban services to attend population demands. By digital photo-interpretation of images, areas occupied by streets, avenues, and car parking areas were identified, quantified and compared with the whole area of the suburbs. Traffic volumes in the main streets of both suburbs were also compared with the area occupied by the road network.

	abstract = {Shortages of street parking can cause cruising, a major source of urban congestion. We used SFpark, a federally funded experiment in market-priced parking in San Francisco, to study how changes in meter prices influenced on-street parking availability. We supervised observations of more than 13,400 vehicles parked on a subset of dynamically priced and control blocks at three points in time during 2011 and 2012. Repeated-observation, change-on-change regressions show that when prices rose, the block-level occupancy of parking fell, suggesting that SFpark worked as intended. But blocks where prices rose showed no discernible improvement in parking availability—the share of time at least one space on a block face was vacant. Price increases also had no association with other factors we would expect to be influenced by price, including parking duration, vehicle turnover, and carpooling. These relationships were robust to controlling for the parking zone, the previous price level, nearby employment, and the weather. A price system designed to improve average occupancy may not improve parking availability, and thus may not reduce cruising. Cities trying to reduce cruising may need to adjust prices based on minimum vacancy, and price changes may need to be larger in many cases.},

However, how curbside parking regulations (i.e. paid parking) affect car ownership remains unclear. Here, we employ a two-way fixed effect model using panel data and difference-in-differences estimations to determine the causal impact of changes in parking regulations and the impact of an extension of a city-wide parking policy in Barcelona. Our results show that the introduction of paid curbside parking to reduce non-resident/visitor demand had a positive impact on resident car ownership levels (who enjoy parking permits for free or at a very low cost – 1€/week). Our calculation of the net social cost of reallocating curbside parking to residents indicates that the costs derived from the residents’ parking subsidy and their likely increase in car usage can easily offset the benefits derived from visitor-trip deterrence, showing the relevance of the tradeoff between efficiency and acceptability.},

	abstract = {Building stocks constitute enduring components of urban infrastructure systems, but little research exists on their residence time or changing environmental impacts. Using Los Angeles County, California, as a case study, a framework is developed for assessing the changes of building stocks in cities (i.e., a generalizable framework for estimating the construction and deconstruction rates), the residence time of buildings and their materials, and the associated embedded environmental impacts. In Los Angeles, previous land-use decisions prove not easily reversible, and past building stock investments may continue to constrain the energy performance of buildings. The average age of the building stock has increased steadily since 1920 and more rapidly after the post–World War II construction surge in the 1950s. Buildings will likely endure for 60 years or longer, making this infrastructure a quasi-permanent investment. The long residence time, combined with the physical limitations on outward growth, suggest that the Los Angeles building stock is unlikely to have substantial spatial expansion in the future. The construction of buildings requires a continuous investment in material, monetary, and energetic resources, resulting in environmental impacts. The long residence time of structures implies a commitment to use and maintain the infrastructure, potentially creating barriers to an urban area's ability to improve energy efficiency. The immotility of buildings, coupled with future environmental goals, indicates that urban areas will be best positioned by instituting strategies that ensure reductions in life cycle (construction, use, and demolition) environmental impacts.},

	abstract = {In 1959, William Vickrey presented a statement, along with exhibits and appencides, to the Joint Committee on Washington Mtropolitan Problems. Judging the material to be of considerable interest in the context of urban economic transport theory and policy, and to rescue it from obscurity, we recommended to the Editor that it be published in the Journal of Urban Economics. The Editor graciously assented, subject to some editing.
The statement provides an overview of Vickrey's thinkin on the technological implementation of efficient urban transport policy. The appendix to the statement presents "A preliminary Sketch of Possible Schemes for Automatic Toll Assessment with Reference to the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Area". Exhibit 51 is an essay, "Reaching an Economic Balance between Mass Transit and Provision for Individual Automobile Traffic". The appendix to that exhivit contains a derivation of Ramsey-Boiteux pricing in the context of urban transportation. Exhibit 52 deals with the "Construction of Tentative Fare Schedules for Washington, DC, Regional Rapid Transit System." Exhibit 53 is an essay on "The Economizing of Curb Parking Space - A suggestion for a new approach to parking meters".
The total length was some 100 typewritten pages. To transform this material into a journal article, we decided to include the statement, moderately edited, along with the appendix on automatic toll assessment and the exhibit on curb parking space. We hope to find a venue for publication of some of the residual matter elsewhere.
The article not only demonstrates Vickrey's creativity, economic intelligence, and farsightedness, but also provides further evidence that he is the source of pricing solutions to urban tranport problems. With the tremendous advances in technology over the last thirty-five years, his proposals are even more compelling now than they were in the originally formulated},

	abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Local governments’ minimum street-width standards may force developers to oversupply, and residents to pay excessively for, on-street parking in residential neighborhoods. Such oversupply is often presumed to both encourage car ownership and reduce housing affordability, although little useful evidence exists either way. This article examines the impact of street-parking supply on the car ownership of households with off-street parking in the New York City area.

The off- and on-street parking supply for each household was measured through Google Street View and Bing Maps. The impact of on-street parking on car ownership levels was then estimated in an innovative multivariate model. The unique set-up of the case study ensures 1) the weak endogeneity between parking supply and car ownership and 2) the low correlation between off-street and on-street parking supply, two major methodological challenges of the study. Results show that free residential street parking increases private car ownership by nearly 9\%; that is, the availability of free street parking explains 1 out of 11 cars owned by households with off-street parking.

Takeaway for practice: These results offer support for community street standards that make on-street parking supply optional. They also suggest the merits of leaving the decisions of whether, and how many, on-street parking spaces to provide in new residential developments to private markets rather than regulations.

Research support: This project was supported by grants from the University Transportation Research Center (Region 2) and the Wagner School Faculty Research Fund.},

It also affects levels of auto ownership by changing the cost of auto ownership. These two facts combine to make parking management an important and powerful tool for both traffic and air-quality management. A pilot analysis of demographics, highway and transit access, and off-street parking in two New York City neighborhoods strongly suggests that the provision of residential off-street parking affects commuting behavior. Moreover, the type of parking provision plays a strong role in determining mode share. Accessory parking that is adjacent to a home, in a garage or driveway, seems more likely to generate auto commutes than does parking in commercial centralized lots. This analysis, which was followed by testing plausible development scenarios, shows that the city's residential off-street parking regulations will undermine its own vision for a sustainable future.},

	abstract = {Parking regulations are a central part of American zoning. There is mounting evidence about the negative effects of parking requirements on the environment and housing affordability. Given this evidence, some cities have reduced or eliminated parking requirements in certain areas. Our research examines how real estate developers respond to municipal parking reforms. We answer two questions. First, how do parking requirements affect the amount of parking provided in new residential developments? Second, how do developers’ responses vary by building and neighborhood characteristics? This research analyzes Seattle, Washington (USA), the site of 2012 policy reforms that reduced or eliminated parking requirements in most central and transit-oriented neighborhoods. Our dataset consists of 868 developments with 60,361 housing units approved between 2012 and 2017. We use descriptive statistics, build a counterfactual scenario, and specify ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to identify relationships between parking requirements and actual parking provision. We find that parking provision is closely, though not completely, tied to parking requirements. More than one-third of developments in the sample included the exact amount of required parking, including about two-thirds of developments subject to a minimum of one parking space per housing unit. About 70\% of developments with no parking requirements did include some parking. Parking requirements were the most important predictor of the actual quantity of parking provision in the regression results using the full sample. There was more parking provision in less dense and mixed-use developments, and in neighborhoods with higher employment densities. Seattle developers built 40\% less parking than would have been required prior to the reforms, resulting in 18,000 fewer parking spaces and saving an estimated \$537 million.},

	abstract = {The US parking infrastructure is vast and little is known about its scale and environmental impacts. The few parking space inventories that exist are typically regionalized and no known environmental assessment has been performed to determine the energy and emissions from providing this infrastructure. A better understanding of the scale of US parking is necessary to properly value the total costs of automobile travel. Energy and emissions from constructing and maintaining the parking infrastructure should be considered when assessing the total human health and environmental impacts of vehicle travel. We develop five parking space inventory scenarios and from these estimate the range of infrastructure provided in the US to be between 105 million and 2 billion spaces. Using these estimates, a life-cycle environmental inventory is performed to capture the energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases, CO, SO2, NOX, VOC (volatile organic compounds), and PM10 (PM: particulate matter) from raw material extraction, transport, asphalt and concrete production, and placement (including direct, indirect, and supply chain processes) of space construction and maintenance. The environmental assessment is then evaluated within the life-cycle performance of sedans, SUVs (sports utility vehicles), and pickups. Depending on the scenario and vehicle type, the inclusion of parking within the overall life-cycle inventory increases energy consumption from 3.1 to 4.8 MJ by 0.1–0.3 MJ and greenhouse gas emissions from 230 to 380 g CO2e by 6–23 g CO2e per passenger kilometer traveled. Life-cycle automobile SO2 and PM10 emissions show some of the largest increases, by as much as 24\% and 89\% from the baseline inventory. The environmental consequences of providing the parking spaces are discussed as well as the uncertainty in allocating paved area between parking and roadways.},

We estimate how parking has grown in Los Angeles County (CA) from 1900 to 2010 and how parking infrastructure evolves, affects urban form, and relates to changes in automobile travel using building and roadway growth models. We find that since 1975 the ratio of residential off-street parking spaces to automobiles in Los Angeles County is close to 1.0 and the greatest density of parking spaces is in the urban core, while most new growth in parking occurs outside of the core. In total, 14\% of Los Angeles County's incorporated land is committed to parking. Uncertainty in our space inventory is attributed to our building growth model, on-street space length, and the assumption that parking spaces were created as per the requirements. Takeaway for practice : The continued use of minimum parking requirements is likely to encourage automobile use at a time when metropolitan areas are actively seeking to manage congestion and increase transit use, biking, and walking. Widely discussed ways to reform parking policies may be less than effective if planners do not consider the remaining incentives to auto use created by the existing parking infrastructure. Planners should encourage the conversion of existing parking facilities to alternative uses.},

	abstract = {Car ownership and car use depend on numerous factors, among which are parking availability at destination and at home. While the former has attracted considerable research efforts for decades the latter, home parking, has recently become subject to increasing research interest. We use evidence from the 2013/14 Norwegian National Travel Survey, and combine this with additional geographical context data. In this way, we analyse the impact of parking availability at home and at destination on car use, while controlling for different urban contexts like housing and job density, and population density. The analysis is divided into three. The first part links car use to availability and payment arrangements of workplace parking. The second is concerned with the impact of home parking accessibility and car use. The third set of regressions looks at the combined effect of parking at trip start and the trip end on car use. Reduced access to free workplace parking stands out as one of the most effective ways of reducing car use on work trips. Maximum parking standards are therefore important parts of an urban planner’s toolbox. Workplace parking fees can be effective when parking capacity is abundant and especially so if payment is made on a daily basis. Car use is in fact almost doubled where employees can pay monthly instead of daily. Limited access to parking at home also affects car use. The decision to drive decreases with increasing walking distance to the car park, especially in densely built-up areas. Restricted parking both at home and at the trip destination add up to very low odds of car use. Parking restrictions will have the greatest effect in compact cities.},

	doi = {10.3141/1977-21},
	abstract = {The debate about parking has shifted in the past decade, as some places attempt to move from conventional development patterns to urban centers modeled on new urbanism and smart growth concepts. There is now less focus on providing sufficient parking to meet demand and more on ensuring that the issue of parking does not undermine the creation of vibrant places. The goal for the presented project is to understand parking and parking provision better as it relates to smaller cities and towns with mixed-use centers. Specifically addressed are how a dense, walk-able, mixed-use center affects parking supply and demand and how mixed-use centers compare with centers designed along more conventional lines. These questions were addressed by conducting case study assessments of six sites in New England. In general, the three mixed-use study sites provided much less parking per square foot than the conventional control sites. The study sites thrived by making much more efficient use of land for parking. The study sites also furnished a significant amount of on-street parking and relied more on shared municipal parking lots and parking garages. Given these differences, it is surprising to note that the towns with mixed-use centers demanded almost as much parking for new construction as did the towns in which the conventional sites are located. On average, the amount of parking mandated by base regulation in these six towns is about two and a half times greater than the peak use.},

Unlike traditional parking models, PARKAGENT simulates the behavior of each driver in a spatially explicit environment and is able to capture the complex self-organizing dynamics of a large collective of parking agents within a non-homogeneous (road) space. The model generates distributions of key values like search time, walking distance, and parking costs over different driver groups. It is developed as an ArcGIS application, and can work with a practically unlimited number of drivers. The advantages of the model are illustrated using a real-life case from Tel Aviv. Taking detailed data from field surveys, the model is used to study the impact of additional parking supply in a residential area with a shortage of parking places. The PARKAGENT model shows that additional parking supply linearly affects the occurrence of extreme values, but has only a weak impact on the average search time for a parking place or the average walking distance between the parking place and the destination.},

	abstract = {Public subsidy of transit services has increased dramatically in recent years, with little effect on overall ridership. Quite obviously, a clear understanding of the factors influencing transit ridership is central to decisions on investments in and the pricing and deployment of transit services. Yet the literature about the causes of transit use is quite spotty; most previous aggregate analyses of transit ridership have examined just one or a few systems, have not included many of the external, control variables thought to influence transit use, and have not addressed the simultaneous relationship between transit service supply and consumption. This study addresses each of these shortcomings by (1) conducting a cross-sectional analysis of transit use in 265 US urbanized areas, (2) testing dozens of variables measuring regional geography, metropolitan economy, population characteristics, auto/highway system characteristics, and transit system characteristics, and (3) constructing two-stage simultaneous equation regression models to account for simultaneity between transit service supply and consumption. We find that most of the variation in transit ridership among urbanized areas – in both absolute and relative terms – can be explained by factors outside of the control of public transit systems: (1) regional geography (specifically, area of urbanization, population, population density, and regional location in the US), (2) metropolitan economy (specifically, personal/household income), (3) population characteristics (specifically, the percent college students, recent immigrants, and Democratic voters in the population), and (4) auto/highway system characteristics (specifically, the percent carless households and non-transit/non-SOV trips, including commuting via carpools, walking, biking, etc.). While these external factors clearly go a long way toward determining the overall level of transit use in an urbanized area, we find that transit policies do make a significant difference. The observed range in both fares and service frequency in our sample could account for at least a doubling (or halving) of transit use in a given urbanized area. Controlling for the fact that public transit use is strongly correlated with urbanized area size, about 26\% of the observed variance in per capita transit patronage across US urbanized areas is explained in the models presented here by service frequency and fare levels. The observed influence of these two factors is consistent with both the literature and intuition: frequent service draws passengers, and high fares drive them away.},

Parking management, which makes the link between land use and transportation, is one of the crucial ways to meet these challenges. In the Greater Montreal Area, data from origin-destination (OD) surveys is helpful in understanding typical travel behaviour. This study processes car driver trips from travel surveys to develop vehicle accumulation profiles and derive theoretical parking supplies from the observed parking demand, defined as the maximal number of cars parked in an area at a given time. This research also provides an assessment of the quality of the estimation by comparing the parking supplies derived from an OD survey to parking supplies estimated from public geographical information systems and field surveys. The paper shows that parking supply is subject to high variability and highlights that its assessment must take into account regulation data (obtained from on-street regulation parking signs data) that modulates the availability of the raw parking supply according to different days and hours of the day.},

	abstract = {Parking has always been a thorny problem in urban transport systems. Parking availability and parking reservation management may have a significant influence on the travel behavior of household travelers. This paper explores the morning commute for household travels by considering parking space constraint and the parking reservation mechanism in a two-mode transport system. Household travelers depart from home to their children’s school by car or by rail and then go to work alone. For household travelers who drive, some household travelers have reserved parking spaces while other household travelers must compete for public ones on a first-come-first-served (FCFS) basis. When household travelers do not have a parking spot, they use rail transit for their commute. We derive ten equilibrium departure patterns based on the school-work time difference, the number of parking spots and the ratio of reserved parking spots. With these equilibrium departure patterns, we thoroughly discuss the impact of school-work time difference on the total travel cost of auto travelers and parking reservation ratio. It is found that, given the school-work time difference, appropriate parking reservation allocation can minimize the total system travel cost. Then, the system performance, including total system travel cost and total congestion cost, is examined by regulating the parking supply, the parking reservation allocation and the school-work time difference. We found that there is a unique optimal parking supply to minimize the total system travel cost, and appropriate staggering policy can alleviate traffic congestion and thus improves social welfare. Finally, numerical analysis is conducted to verify the findings, and the Pareto frontier for system performance is analyzed. Traffic authorities can select the optimal solution based on the preferences of traffic indicators to develop effective strategies to manage morning commuting of household travels with parking space constraint. The study demonstrates that implementing reasonable staggering policy and efficient parking management can effectively promote efficiency of urban morning commuting systems and reduce social costs for household travelers.},

In this paper, we: (a) explore literature linking parking policies and vehicle use (including vehicle trip generation, vehicle miles traveled [VMT], and trip length) through the lens of development-level evaluations (e.g., transportation impact analyses [TIA]); (b) develop a conceptual map linking development-level parking characteristics and vehicle use outcomes based on previously supported theory and frameworks; and (c) evaluate and discuss the conventional approach to identify the steps needed to operationalize this link, specifically for residential development. Our findings indicate a significant and noteworthy dearth of studies incorporating parking constraints into travel behavior studies—including, but not limited to: parking supply, costs or pricing, and travel demand management strategies such as the impacts of (un)bundled parking in housing costs. Disregarding parking in TIAs ignores a significant indicator in automobile use. Further, unconstrained parking may encourage increases in car ownership, vehicle trips, and VMT in areas with robust alternative-mode networks and accessibility, thus creating greater demand for vehicle travel than would otherwise occur. The conceptual map offers a means for operationalizing the links between: the built environment; socio-economic and demographic characteristics; fixed and variable travel costs; and vehicle use.

	abstract = {Parking supply is one of the most neglected elements of the built environment in travel behavior research, despite evidence linking parking with vehicle use. As transportation impacts of new development are increasingly measured by vehicle miles traveled (VMT), explicitly connecting parking characteristics with vehicle travel is necessary to better inform transportation and land use policy. In this paper, we begin to address this research gap and explore the relationship between constrained parking and household VMT. Utilizing the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) California add-on sample, we estimate residential parking constraint for households in Los Angeles County. Then, we develop a two-level model framework. Level 1 (Cost) models estimate travel costs, represented by vehicle ownership as a function of parking constraints, the built environment, and demographics. Level 2 (Demand) models regress household-level total and homebased-work VMT on predicted vehicle ownership, controlling for temporal and environmental characteristics. To further explore the relationship between parking and VMT by place type, we applied Level 1 and Level 2 models to develop a suite of scenarios for typical households in Los Angeles County. Our findings support the hypothesis that the built environment (including parking) influences VMT through travel costs (vehicle ownership). Results from scenarios analysis reveal constrained on-site residential parking ({\textless} 1 parking space per dwelling unit), accounts for an approximate 10–23 percentage-point decrease in VMT within each place type. Finally, implications for practice and future research are presented.},

	abstract = {Few studies have investigated how parking requirements (norms) for households and home parking availability influence car ownership and car-use. The common practice of local authorities is to use minimum parking norms for housing, and, in some urban areas, also maximum parking norms. This means that local authorities in general do not aim to influence car-use or car ownership by, for example, restricting the number of parking spaces or locating them some distance away. The objective of this paper is to analyse whether there are systematic differences in car ownership and car-use that can be linked to differences in parking norms, parking facilities and location. This knowledge would be of value to both the research community and authorities. We use the dataset of the Norwegian National Travel Survey (NTS) 2013 consisting of about 60,000 interviews of individuals 13 years and older. A sample of over 2,000 urban dwellers was selected from this NTS for an additional in-depth parking survey. We asked detailed questions about home parking. The NTS 2013 and parking survey were merged and travel habits and background variables linked with detailed information about home parking availability. This provided an excellent opportunity to analyse how variations in parking facilities influence travel behaviour and car ownership. Our data show that access to private or reserved parking triples the likelihood of car ownership. Trip frequency does not change with car ownership or access to home parking, but it does affect mode share. The longer the distance between home and the actual location of home parking the more reduced the car modal share. People are on average willing to accept more than 100 m between home and home parking. Physical separation of the two would therefore facilitate more efficient housing and less car driving. Free street parking may jeopardise this, however.},

However, parking is costly to provide and encourages automobile use, according to many site-specific studies. At the city scale, higher automobile use is linked to traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and negative health and safety impacts, but there is a lack of compelling, consolidated evidence that large-scale parking increases cause automobile use to rise. In this study, the Bradford Hill criteria, adopted from the field of epidemiology, were applied to determine whether increases in parking should be considered a likely cause of citywide increases in automobile use. Prior research and original data from nine U.S. cities dating to 1960 were relied on. It was found that an increase in parking provision from 0.1 to 0.5 parking space per person was associated with an increase in automobile mode share of roughly 30 percentage points. It was also demonstrated that a majority of the Bradford Hill criteria could be satisfied by using the available data; this finding offers compelling evidence that parking provision is a cause of citywide automobile use. Given the costs associated with parking and its apparent effects on automobile use, these findings warrant policies to restrict and reduce parking capacity in cities.},

The paper analyzes 770 households randomly selected from a household travel survey in the New York City region, and measures their complete parking supply, including garage size, driveway spaces, and on-street parking availability, using Google Streetviews and Bing Maps. Results from a nested logit model show that parking supply can significantly determine household car ownership decisions, even after controlling for the endogeneity between the two. Their influence actually outperforms household income and demographic characteristics, the often-assumed dominant determinants of car ownership. Different parking types also behave differently: driveway spaces are more important to car ownership than garages probably because many residents in the study region do not use a garage for car storage. On-street parking is also important to households with off-street parking. Implications for residential parking policies like the maximum off-street parking standard, resident parking permit, and street cleaning are also discussed.},

	abstract = {This dissertation examines the impact of parking policies and social influence on commute
mode choice using discrete choice analysis. A key feature of the dissertation is overcoming the
problem of insufficient data by using unique datasets, building unique datasets, or exploring
appropriate estimation strategies and assumptions.
Chapter 1 studies the impact of parking prices on the decision to drive to work using the
California Household Travel Survey. The chapter tackles estimation challenges posed by
insufficient parking information. The first challenge is the estimation of parking prices for
those who do not drive, which is addressed by using a sample selection model. The second
challenge is to understand the effect of the extent of the prevalence of Employer-Paid parking
coupled with incentive programs offered in-lieu of parking. To address this challenge, two
extreme scenarios are examined, and a range for the marginal effects of parking prices is
estimated; one scenario assumes everyone receives Employer-Paid parking coupled with in-
lieu of parking incentives, and the second assumes that no one is offered such incentives.
The results suggest that higher parking prices reduce driving, regardless of the followed
approach. It is estimated that a 10\% increase in parking prices leads to a 1 - 2 percentage
point decline in the probability of driving to work. Moreover, there seems to be no evidence of
xi
sample selection bias. The evidence suggests that parking pricing can indeed be an effective
transportation demand management tool.
Chapter 2 extends the analysis of Chapter 1 to simultaneously estimate the impact of parking
pricing, parking availability, and urban form on commute mode choice. The joint role of
these three factors is examined using a dataset that is constructed by merging three major
different data sources. The California Household Travel Survey data are matched to two
unique datasets on parking for Los Angeles County; one for prices and the other availability.
Chapter 2 first examines how these three factors affect the binary decision of whether to
drive, while controlling for a rich set of covariates. The analysis then becomes more specific
and examines how these factors affect particular commute modes in a multinomial context.
The results indicate that parking prices have a significant negative impact on the decision
to drive to work, where a 10\% increase in parking prices is associated with a 1.1\% drop
in the probability of driving to work. Both on-street and off-street parking availability at
home, as well as urban form measures of the workplace tract, are found to significantly
affect commute mode choices. These findings have important policy implications in terms of
minimum parking requirements, maximum parking standards, employer-paid parking, and
parking pricing policies.
Chapter 3, on the other hand, examines the impact of a number of fundamental determinants of commute mode choice on transit use, and introduces the role of social influence. The determinants explored cover socioeconomic characteristics, built environment and neighborhood characteristics, transit accessibility, and trip characteristics. Social interactions have been found to affect many of the decisions of economic agents, and are likely to play a role in the decision to use transit. A unique dataset is built to conduct this analysis across a number of major US cities and examine the effects in both the residence and workplace neighborhoods, where a neighborhood is defined as a census tract. Social influence is explored along three different dimensions: space (neighborhood), income, and race. A novel instrumental variable is constructed in order to identify spatial social influence, and an alternative identification
strategy is devised to identify income-group and racial social influence. The evidence sug-
gests that spatial social influence exists among both coworkers and residential neighbors,
and that peer effects among coworkers are larger than those among residential neighbors.
Moreover, income-group social influence, among both coworkers and residential neighbors,
plays a significant role in the rich commuter’s decision to use transit. However, racial social
influence does not affect a commuter’s decision to use transit, regardless of r},

	abstract = {Parking spaces are becoming strategic commodities in central urban areas. Nevertheless, few datasets allow to precisely measuring the use of these spaces in terms of population segments, activity types and duration. In order to document this issue, this paper proposes some empirical measures and methods regarding the use of parking spaces in a strategic urban area. This analysis is conducted with specific data collected during two recent large scale travel surveys held in the Greater Montreal Area. The Montreal Region has a long experience in conducting travel surveys with large samples of people. Actually, phone surveys on daily travel behaviours have been held for more than thirty years, approximately every five years, since 1970. Collected sample represent 5\% of the population (app. 70 000 households in 2003). 
In the two latest surveys (1998 and 2003), a new question was added to gather data regarding the use of parking spaces in central urban areas. Car drivers heading towards these areas wereenquired regarding the type of parking space used. Parking spaces were classified according to their jurisdiction (private/public), location (indoor/on the street/outdoor) and rates (free/fee- charging/subsidized by the employer). Using these data, statistics describing the use of these spaces are developed. On the one hand, people benefiting from the various types of parking spaces are described in terms of residence location, demographic attributes and type of activity. On the other hand, parking accumulation profiles are developed and summarised by key indicators.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the extent to which high quality public transport can support reduced car parking requirements for new residential apartment buildings. Using a case study of Melbourne, the demand for car parking at residential apartment buildings in proximity to high frequency public transport is assessed, while controlling for a range of socio-demographic, urban design and demand management variables. Key findings indicate that while lower demand for car parking is associated with proximity to high quality public transport, this association is not significant when controlling for other factors that influence car ownership. Public transport service supply within 800 m of residential apartment buildings was instead found to be significant, rather than simple distance to transit. Modelling results suggest an inelastic relationship whereby a 10\% increase in public transport service supply is associated with a 0.9–1.2\% reduction in car parking demand as measured by levels of car ownership. Notwithstanding broader criticisms of residential off-street parking minimums, the findings have important implications for the development of residential car parking policies, suggesting that city-wide car parking requirements should appropriately reflect the spatial distribution and quality of public transport services.},

This study aims to investigate the joint effect of built environment and parking availability on car ownership and use based on a household travel survey conducted in Changchun, China. The binary logistic model was first employed to investigate the determinants of the car ownership in Changchun. Next, this study examined the potential impacts of the built environment and parking availability on car use for the journey to work. The result shows that built environment and parking availability can be both significantly associated with car ownership and use after controlling for the socio-economic characteristics. Moreover, in contrast with the model ignoring the parking availability, the model for car use considering the joint effect fit the data better. The results indicate that car dependency depends on the joint effect of the built environment and parking availability. These results suggest that transit-oriented urban expansion and compact land use can contribute to reducing car commuting. Meanwhile, parking restrictions at both trip start and end would be effective for sustainable transport because parking oversupply could encourage more car dependency.},

However, automobile infrastructure can consume significant amounts of land that could otherwise be used for non-transportation activities. Theory suggests that as automobile mode share increases in a city, the amount of land used for transportation also increases, whereas the land available for other uses decreases. This can result in a loss of activities from the city. This study compiles data from 12 cities in the United States to test these theoretical relationships. The findings suggest that on average each increase of 10 percentage points in the portion of commuters traveling by automobile is associated with an increase of more than 2500 m2 of parking per 1000 people and a decrease of 1700 people/km2. In quantifying these relationships, this work provides a basis for assessing the potential impacts of transportation policy decisions on land use and on the concentration of people in cities.

	url = {https://energie.hec.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rapport-ParcAutomobile_web.pdf},
	abstract = {Ce rapport expose les tendances du parc automobile du Québec entre 2013 et 2021. Il a été réalisé dans le cadre du projet « Caractérisation énergétique et des émissions de
gaz à effet de serre (GES) du parc de véhicules légers immatriculés au Québec » pour le gouvernement du Québec. Il se concentre sur les véhicules légers (voitures et camions légers) immatriculés au Québec.

Trois grandes observations se dégagent :
1. Gains d’efficacité énergétique des véhicules. L’efficacité du parc de véhicules s’améliore au fil du temps. La consommation moyenne des véhicules a baissé de 7 \%, passant de 9,9 l/100 km à 9,2 l/100 km entre 2013 et 2021.
2. Croissance et vieillissement du parc automobile et des véhicules. Le parc de véhicules (+10,9 \%) croît plus rapidement que la population (+6,1 \%). La masse moyenne (+5,6 \%) et les dimensions des véhicules sont aussi en augmentation. Cela s’explique par la proportion croissante de camions légers (e.g. VUS, camionnettes), passée de 37,4 \% en 2013 à 49,3 \% en 2021. Les véhicules sont aussi gardés plus longtemps dans le parc, avec un âge moyen passant de 7,2 ans en 2013 à 8,2 en 2021.
3. Arrivée des véhicules électriques. Même si en 2021 les véhicules électriques (entièrement électriques et hybrides branchables) étaient encore marginaux, leur croissance est très importante. En 2021, 2,3 \% du parc automobile était électrique. Les véhicules électriques ont aussi tendance à devenir plus gros et plus lourd.
Ces trois grandes observations, ainsi que les autres faites dans ce rapport, permettent d’identifier cinq enjeux quant à l’évolution future du parc automobile.
Enjeu 1 : Rythme de décroissance du taux de consommation moyen. Bien que le taux de consommation soit en nette décroissance, il aurait le potentiel de diminuer plus rapidement. En effet, la consommation moyenne de chaque classe de véhicules diminue davantage que le taux moyen de l’ensemble du parc.
Enjeu 2 : Tendance vers les gros véhicules. Le passage à des véhicules plus gros, et donc moins économes en énergie (autant pour les véhicules utilisant des produits pétroliers que l’électricité), ralentit les progrès d’efficacité énergétique qui pourraient se réaliser. Pour réduire la consommation de produits pétroliers, réduire les émissions de GES et limiter la hausse de la demande d’électricité, des véhicules moins imposants et plus
légers devraient être promus.
Enjeu 3 : Croissance du parc automobile. La prolifération des véhicules légers, en plus de la croissance de leurs dimensions, pose des enjeux de fluidité sur le réseau routier. Autant pour les véhicules électriques que ceux à essence, la société québécoise gagnerait à limiter le nombre de véhicules sur son réseau routier.
Enjeu 4 : Parc automobile vieillissant. L’augmentation de l’âge moyen des véhicules fera en sorte que les véhicules utilisant des produits pétroliers seront utilisés plus longtemps, ralentissant par le fait même la décarbonation du parc automobile et la réduction d’autres polluants nuisibles.
Enjeu 5 : Les femmes en voie de rattraper les hommes. Les préférences des femmes se rapprochent de celles des hommes en matière de choix de véhicules. Entre 2013 et 2021, même si les hommes ont encore davantage de véhicules que les femmes, et des véhicules plus énergivores et plus lourds, la tendance est à une croissance plus rapide du nombre et de la masse des véhicules immatriculés au nom de femmes.},

	abstract = {RÉSUMÉ: De plus en plus de documents de planification, au Québec et ailleurs, contiennent des objectifs relatifs à l'amélioration du partage de la rue entre ses divers usagers : piétons, cyclistes, usagers du transport collectif, automobilistes, notamment. Plusieurs démarches visent également à rétablir un équilibre entre les différentes dimensions de la rue : la rue comme lien, c'est-à-dire comme espace dédié à la mobilité, mais aussi la rue comme lieu, c'est-à-dire comme espace d'activités, ainsi que la rue comme espace accueillant des fonctions environnementales. Ce partage de l'espace de la rue est le produit d'un arbitrage politique, administratif et technique entre les divers modes, arbitrage sous-tendu par des principes implicites ou explicites d'équité. De plus, le partage de l'espace urbain est changeant : il varie selon l'heure de la journée, le jour de la semaine et la période de l'année. Toutefois, peu de méthodes d'évaluation et d'indicateurs de suivi ont été proposés pour assurer la mise en oeuvre des objectifs publics en matière de partage de la rue. Alors même que les pouvoirs publics investissent des sommes colossales dans le réaménagement des infrastructures urbaines dans le but d'en améliorer le partage, il n'existe toujours pas de mesures à grande échelle pour étudier le caractère équitable de ce partage et pour en assurer le suivi dans le temps. Quelques méthodes ont été proposées, mais toutes ces méthodes dépendent de relevés effectués sur le terrain ou encore d'une classification manuelle des surfaces à l'aide de photos satellites. Il n'existe ainsi, à l'heure actuelle, aucune méthode systématique pour effectuer le diagnostic du partage de l'espace de la rue à l'échelle d'un territoire urbain. Le partage de l'espace urbain reste donc un concept difficile à définir, à mesurer et à évaluer dans le temps.  
ABSTRACT: More and more planning documents, in Québec and elsewhere, aim to reallocate street space between the various users of the street, namely pedestrians, cyclists, public transit riders and motorists. Several approaches also aim to restore a balance between the different dimensions of the street: the street as a link, i.e., a space dedicated to mobility, but also the street as a place, i.e., an activity space, as well as the street as a space dedicated to environmental functions. The allocation of street space is the product of a political, administrative and technical arbitration between the various modes and uses of the street, an arbitration underpinned by implicit or explicit principles of justice. In addition, the allocation of urban space is not fixed: it varies according to the time of day, the day of the week and the time of year. However, few evaluation methods and monitoring indicators have been proposed to oversee the realization of public goals in terms of street space reallocation. Even though authorities invest colossal sums in the redevelopment of urban streets, there are still no generalizable measures to study the equitable nature of these reallocation operations and to ensure their fairness or to monitor their evolution over time. A few methods have been proposed, but they depend on surveys carried out in the field or on a manual classification of surfaces using satellite photos. At the present time, there is no systematic method for carrying out the diagnosis of the sharing of street space at a city scale. The equity of street space allocation therefore remains a difficult concept to define, measure and evaluate over time.},

This technique has numerous real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, image editing, robot sensing, and medical analysis. Over the past decade, deep learning-based methods have made remarkable strides in this area. Recently, transformers, a type of neural network based on self-attention originally designed for natural language processing, have considerably surpassed previous convolutional or recurrent approaches in various vision processing tasks. Specifically, vision transformers offer robust, unified, and even simpler solutions for various segmentation tasks. This survey provides a thorough overview of transformer-based visual segmentation, summarizing recent advancements. We first review the background, encompassing problem definitions, datasets, and prior convolutional methods. Next, we summarize a meta-architecture that unifies all recent transformer-based approaches. Based on this meta-architecture, we examine various method designs, including modifications to the meta-architecture and associated applications. We also present several closely related settings, including 3D point cloud segmentation, foundation model tuning, domain-aware segmentation, efficient segmentation, and medical segmentation. Additionally, we compile and re-evaluate the reviewed methods on several well-established datasets. Finally, we identify open challenges in this field and propose directions for future research.

	abstract = {In this work we consider the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pixel-wise labeling (a.k.a., semantic segmentation) of remote sensing imagery (e.g., aerial color or hyperspectral imagery). Remote sensing imagery is usually stored in the form of very large images, referred to as "tiles", which are too large to be segmented directly using most CNNs and their associated hardware. As a result, during label inference, smaller sub-images, called "patches", are processed individually and then "stitched" (concatenated) back together to create a tile-sized label map. This approach suffers from computational ineffiency and can result in discontinuities at output boundaries. We propose a simple alternative approach in which the input size of the CNN is dramatically increased only during label inference. This does not avoid stitching altogether, but substantially mitigates its limitations. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against a vonventional stitching approach using two popular segmentation CNN models and two large-scale remote sensing imagery datasets. The results suggest that the proposed approach substantially reduces label inference time, while also yielding modest overall label accuracy increases. This approach contributed to our wining entry (overall performance) in the INRIA building labeling competition.},

	abstract = {We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation framework which unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders. The proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus combining both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation on Transformers.  We scale our approach up to obtain a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to Segformer-B5, which reaches much better performance and efficiency than previous counterparts.For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3\% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5x smaller and 2.2\% better than the previous best method. Our best model, SegFormer-B5, achieves 84.0\% mIoU on Cityscapes validation set and shows excellent zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes-C.},

To handle the problem of segmenting objects at multiple scales, we design modules which employ atrous convolution in cascade or in parallel to capture multi-scale context by adopting multiple atrous rates. Furthermore, we propose to augment our previously proposed Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, which probes convolutional features at multiple scales, with image-level features encoding global context and further boost performance. We also elaborate on implementation details and share our experience on training our system. The proposed `DeepLabv3' system significantly improves over our previous DeepLab versions without DenseCRF post-processing and attains comparable performance with other state-of-art models on the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation benchmark.},

	abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by "learning without a teacher", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname "neocognitron". After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells', which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any "teacher" during the process of selforganization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cells of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

	abstract = {We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition.

To aid researchers in identifying the optimal loss function for their particular application, this survey provides a comprehensive and unified review of \$25\$ loss functions utilized in image segmentation. We provide a novel taxonomy and thorough review of how these loss functions are customized and leveraged in image segmentation, with a systematic categorization emphasizing their significant features and applications. Furthermore, to evaluate the efficacy of these methods in real-world scenarios, we propose unbiased evaluations of some distinct and renowned loss functions on established medical and natural image datasets.

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

	abstract = {Many modern visual recognition algorithms incorporate a step of spatial ‘pooling’, where the outputs of several nearby feature detectors are combined into a local or global ‘bag of features’, in a way that preserves task-related information while removing irrelevant details. Pooling is used to achieve invariance to image transformations, more compact representations, and better robustness to noise and clutter. Several papers have shown that the details of the pooling operation can greatly inﬂuence the performance, but studies have so far been purely empirical. In this paper, we show that the reasons underlying the performance of various pooling methods are obscured by several confounding factors, such as the link between the sample cardinality in a spatial pool and the resolution at which low-level features have been extracted. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of max pooling and average pooling, and give extensive empirical comparisons for object recognition tasks.},

Inspired by such significant achievements, some pioneering works have recently been done on employing Transformer-liked architectures in the computer vision (CV) field, which have demonstrated their effectiveness on three fundamental CV tasks (classification, detection, and segmentation) as well as multiple sensory data stream (images, point clouds, and vision-language data). Because of their competitive modeling capabilities, the visual Transformers have achieved impressive performance improvements over multiple benchmarks as compared with modern convolution neural networks (CNNs). In this survey, we have reviewed over 100 of different visual Transformers comprehensively according to three fundamental CV tasks and different data stream types, where taxonomy is proposed to organize the representative methods according to their motivations, structures, and application scenarios. Because of their differences on training settings and dedicated vision tasks, we have also evaluated and compared all these existing visual Transformers under different configurations. Furthermore, we have revealed a series of essential but unexploited aspects that may empower such visual Transformers to stand out from numerous architectures, e.g., slack high-level semantic embeddings to bridge the gap between the visual Transformers and the sequential ones. Finally, two promising research directions are suggested for future investment.

Hence, determining which ML/DL algorithm is most suitable for a speciﬁc application domain and its related data sets would be a key advantage. To respond to this need, a comparative analysis of well-known ML/DL techniques, including Multilayer Perceptron, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Voting Classiﬁer (or the Ensemble Learning Approach) for the prediction of parking space availability has been conducted. This comparison utilized Santander’s parking data set, initiated while working on the H2020 WISE-IoT project. The data set was used in order to evaluate the considered algorithms and to determine the one offering the best prediction. The results of this analysis show that, regardless of the data set size, the less complex algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN outperform complex algorithms such as Multilayer Perceptron, in terms of higher prediction accuracy, while providing comparable information for the prediction of parking space availability. In addition, in this paper, we are providing Top-K parking space recommendations on the basis of distance between current position of vehicles and free parking spots.},

	abstract = {Urban land-use mapping is a significant yet challenging task in the field of remote sensing. Although numerous classification methods have been developed for obtaining land-use information in urban areas, the accuracy and efficiency of these methods are insufficient to meet the requirements of real-world applications such as urban planning and land management. In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), have achieved an astonishing level of performance in image classification. However, the traditional DCNN methods do not focus on multispectral remote sensing images with more than three channels, and they are limited by their training samples. In addition, these methods uniformly decompose large images into small processing units, which chop up the land-use patterns and produce land-use maps with obvious “blocks”. In this study, a semi-transfer deep convolutional neural network (STDCNN) approach is proposed to overcome these weaknesses. The proposed STDCNN has three parts: one part involves a transferred DCNN with deep architecture; another part is designed to analyze multispectral images; and the final part fuses the first two parts into a classification layer. Moreover, a skeleton-based decomposing method using street block data is devised to maintain the integrity of the land-use patterns. In two case studies, the proposed method is used to generate urban land-use maps from a WorldView-3 image of a 143 km2 area of Hong Kong and a WorldView-2 image of a 25 km2 area of Shenzhen. The results show that the proposed STDCNN obtains an overall accuracy (OA) of 91.25\% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.903 for Hong Kong land-use classification, and an OA of 80\% and a Kappa of 0.780 for Shenzhen land-use classification. In addition, due to the proposed skeleton-based decomposition method, the proposed method can produce better land-use maps for real-world urban applications.},

	abstract = {Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed urban scene images is required in a wide range of practical applications, such as land cover mapping, urban change detection, environmental protection, and economic assessment. Driven by rapid developments in deep learning technologies, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has dominated semantic segmentation for many years. CNN adopts hierarchical feature representation, demonstrating strong capabilities for information extraction. However, the local property of the convolution layer limits the network from capturing the global context. Recently, as a hot topic in the domain of computer vision, Transformer has demonstrated its great potential in global information modelling, boosting many vision-related tasks such as image classification, object detection, and particularly semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based decoder and construct an UNet-like Transformer (UNetFormer) for real-time urban scene segmentation. For efficient segmentation, the UNetFormer selects the lightweight ResNet18 as the encoder and develops an efficient global–local attention mechanism to model both global and local information in the decoder. Extensive experiments reveal that our method not only runs faster but also produces higher accuracy compared with state-of-the-art lightweight models. Specifically, the proposed UNetFormer achieved 67.8\% and 52.4\% mIoU on the UAVid and LoveDA datasets, respectively, while the inference speed can achieve up to 322.4 FPS with a 512 × 512 input on a single NVIDIA GTX 3090 GPU. In further exploration, the proposed Transformer-based decoder combined with a Swin Transformer encoder also achieves the state-of-the-art result (91.3\% F1 and 84.1\% mIoU) on the Vaihingen dataset.

This study introduces the masked-attention mask transformer (Mask2Former), based on the Swin Transformer, for building footprint extraction from large-scale satellite imagery. To enhance the capture of large-scale semantic information and extract multiscale features, a hierarchical vision transformer with shifted windows (Swin Transformer) serves as the backbone network. An extensive analysis compares the efficiency and generalizability of Mask2Former with four CNN models (PSPNet, DeepLabV3+, UpperNet-ConvNext, and SegNeXt) and two transformer-based models (UpperNet-Swin and SegFormer) featuring different complexities. Results reveal superior performance of transformer-based models over CNN-based counterparts, showcasing exceptional generalization across diverse testing areas with varying building structures, heights, and sizes. Specifically, Mask2Former with the Swin transformer backbone achieves a mean intersection over union between 88\% and 93\%, along with a mean F-score (mF-score) ranging from 91\% to 96.35\% across various urban landscapes.},

Aerial images provide valuable information over a large area instantaneously; nevertheless, no current dataset captures the complexity of aerial scenes at the level of granularity required by real-world applications. To address this, we introduce SkyScapes, an aerial image dataset with highly-accurate, fine-grained annotations for pixel-level semantic labeling. SkyScapes provides annotations for 31 semantic categories ranging from large structures, such as buildings, roads and vegetation, to fine details, such as 12 (sub-)categories of lane markings. We have defined two main tasks on this dataset: dense semantic segmentation and multi-class lane-marking prediction. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate state-of-the-art segmentation methods on SkyScapes. Existing methods struggle to deal with the wide range of classes, object sizes, scales, and fine details present. We therefore propose a novel multi-task model, which incorporates semantic edge detection and is better tuned for feature extraction from a wide range of scales. This model achieves notable improvements over the baselines in region outlines and level of detail on both tasks.},

	abstract = {More complexities in urban areas due to the existence of buildings with roofs made of various materials, roads and parking lots, diverse plant species and vehicles along with developed very high spatial resolution (VHR) remote sensing imageries lead to increase the difficulties of urban objects recognition. Defining human cognition semantic categories of land cover objects is proposed in this paper to improve the object-based scene analysis. After performing the segmentation algorithm, semantically feature fusion of the VHR imagery and Lidar DSM is performed in the context of object-based procedures. For this reason, high-level semantics composed of human cognition object categorization and visual–conceptual descriptions of land cover objects in the complex urban scene is used for low-level features measurement followed by classification rules generation. The pan-sharpened WorldView-2 satellite image and Lidar DSM over a complex urban area in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) are used to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed semantic object-based scene analysis. The evaluation of the obtained object recognition results shows the 93.98\% overall accuracy and 0.937 Kappa coefficient. Comparing the obtained semantic object recognition results with non-semantic object-based procedures indicates the improvements in overall accuracy for 20.68 and 2.18\% in object-based spectral and object-based spectral–structural classifications, respectively. Increasing the true positive pixels of the spectrally and height similar object categories (such as buildings and road), and using threshold training without requiring high-dimensional training samples are some of the advantages of the proposed semantic object-based scene analysis method.},

	abstract = {Road network information simplifies autonomous driving by providing strong priors about environments. It informs a robotic vehicle with where it can drive, models of what can be expected, and contextual cues that influence driving behaviors. Currently, however, road network information is manually generated using a combination of GPS survey and aerial imagery. These manual techniques are labor intensive and error prone. To fully exploit the benefits of digital imagery, these processes should be automated. As a step toward this goal, we present an algorithm that extracts the structure of a parking lot visible from a given aerial image. To minimize human intervention in the use of aerial imagery, we devise a self-supervised learning algorithm that automatically generates a set of parking spot templates to learn the appearance of a parking lot and estimates the structure of the parking lot from the learned model. The data set extracted from a single image alone is too small to sufficiently learn an accurate parking spot model. However, strong priors trained using large data sets collected across multiple images dramatically improve performance. Our self-supervised approach outperforms the prior alone by adapting the distribution of examples toward that found in the current image. A thorough empirical analysis compares leading state-of-the-art learning techniques on this problem.},

	abstract = {Parking block regions host dangerous behaviors that can be detected from a surveillance camera perspective. However, these regions are often occluded, subject to ground bumpiness or steep slopes, and thus they are hard to segment. Firstly, the paper proposes a pyramidal solution that takes advantage of satellite views of the same scene, based on a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Training a CNN from the surveillance camera perspective is rather impossible due to the combinatory explosion generated by multiple point-of-views. However, CNNs showed great promise on previous works over satellite images. Secondly, even though there are many datasets for occupancy detection in parking lots, none of them were designed to tackle the parking block segmentation problem directly. Given the lack of a suitable dataset, we also propose APKLOT, a dataset of roughly 7000 polygons for segmenting parking blocks from the satellite perspective and from the camera perspective. Moreover, our method achieves more than 50\% intersection over union (IoU) in all the testing sets, that is, at both the satellite view and the camera view.},

	abstract = {Outdoor parking lot vacancy detection systems have attracted a great deal of attention in the last decade due the large number of practical applications. However, a common problem that researchers in this field very often face is the lack of a representative dataset to perform their experiments. To mitigate this difficulty, in this paper we introduce a new parking lot dataset composed of 695,899 images captured from two parking lots with three different camera views. The acquisition protocol allows obtaining static images showing illumination variance related to sunny, overcast and rainy days. We believe that researchers will find this dataset a very useful tool since it allows future benchmarking and evaluation. The dataset is currently available for research purposes upon request. To gain a better insight into this dataset we have evaluated two textural descriptors, Local Binary Patterns and Local Phase Quantization, with a Support Vector Machine classifier to detect parking lot vacancy. In the experiments where the same view was used for both training and testing, we have reached outstanding recognition rates, greater than 99\%. The main challenge, though, lies in building a general classifier that is able to detect parking spaces from the parking lots that were not used for training. In this sense, the best result achieved by the texture-based classifier was about 89\%. The observed drop in terms of performance shows that additional investigation is necessary to create classification schemes less dependent on the training set. Other researchers can use these results as a baseline performance when testing their own algorithms on this dataset.},

However, data quality is often low: managed parking places may only be partially inventoried, or parking at the curbside and on private ground may be missing. This paper presents a processing chain in which remote sensing data and statistical methods are combined to provide parking area estimates. First, parking spaces and other traffic areas are detected from aerial imagery using a convolutional neural network. Individual image segmentations are fused to increase completeness. Next, a Gamma hurdle model is estimated using the detected parking areas and OpenStreetMap and land use data to predict the parking area adjacent to streets. A systematic relationship is found between the road length and type and the parking area obtained. It is suggested that these results are informative to those needing information on parking in structurally similar regions. © 2022 The Authors.

	volume = {2},
	abstract = {Remote sensing exhibits a great potential for enhancing current urban planning processes. Literature review, however, indicates that there is a significant gap between its technology development and applications in urban planning because of discipline barriers. This study is, therefore, intent to address such a gap by studying the effectiveness of two image classification software (ENVI 4.5 and Definiens Professional 5) on extracting urban subzonal land covers, and investigating the usefulness/accuracy of the extracted information in urban planning process. Several satellite images, including Landsat ETM+, SPOT4, IKONOS, and QuickBird, are used in our testing. It is found that medium-resolution images, such as Landsat ETM+ and SPOT4, are only good at extracting large-size homogeneous objects, such as vegetation and water bodies, but less powerful in extracting small urban features, including buildings, streets and parking lots, due to their low spatial resolutions. Later experiments focus on extracting these small-size urban features with VHR imagery from IKONOS and QuickBird. Classification results show that both software packages have more or less problems in distinguish parking lots, streets and building roofs because of similar materials used and therefore, very close spectral signatures. It is found that the object-oriented hierarchical algorithm applied to QuickBird images offers the highest extraction accuracy for building and street classes with a producer's accuracy (PA) of 78\% and 63\% respectively, when compared to other algorithms, such as maximum likelihood and nearest neighbour, and images (QuickBird and IKONOS) combinations. Recommendations and discussions about how to improve the current results by using off-leave images and supplementary data are also presented.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Semantic segmentation is a fundamental but challenging problem of pixel-level remote sensing (RS) data analysis. Semantic segmentation tasks based on aerial and satellite images play an important role in a wide range of applications. Recently, with the successful applications of deep learning (DL) in the computer vision (CV) field, more and more researchers have introduced and improved DL methods to the task of RS data semantic segmentation and achieved excellent results. Although there are a large number of DL methods, there remains a deficiency in the evaluation and advancement of semantic segmentation techniques for RS data. To solve the problem, this paper surveys more than 100 papers in this field in the past 5 years and elaborates in detail on the aspects of technical framework classification discussion, datasets, experimental evaluation, research challenges, and future research directions. Different from several previously published surveys, this paper first focuses on comprehensively summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of techniques and models based on the important and difficult points. This research will help beginners quickly establish research ideas and processes in this field, allowing them to focus on algorithm innovation without paying too much attention to datasets, evaluation indicators, and research frameworks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Building extraction from high-resolution aerial imagery plays an important role in geospatial applications such as urban planning, telecommunication, disaster monitoring, navigation, updating geographic databases, and urban dynamic monitoring. Automatic building extraction is a challenging task, as the buildings in different regions have different spectral and geometric properties. Therefore, the classical image processing techniques are not sufficient for automatic building extraction from high-resolution aerial imagery applications. Deep learning and semantic segmentation models, which have gained popularity in recent years, have been used for automatic object extraction from high-resolution images. U-Net model, which was originally developed for biomedical image processing, was used for building extraction. The encoder part of the U-Net model has been modified with Vgg16, InceptionResNetV2, and DenseNet121 convolutional neural networks. Therefore, building extraction was performed using Vgg16 U-Net, InceptionResNetV2 U-Net, and DenseNet121 U-Net models. In the fourth method, the results obtained from each U-Net model were combined in order to obtain the final result by maximum voting. This study aims to compare the performance of these four methods in building extraction from high-resolution aerial imagery. Images of Chicago from the Inria Aerial Image Labeling Dataset were used in the study. The images used have 0.3 m spatial resolution, 8-bit radiometric resolution and 3-band (red, green, and blue bands). Images consist of 36 tiles and they were divided into image subsets of 512x512 pixels. Thus, a total of 2715 image subsets were formed. 80\% of the image subsets (2172 image subset) were used as training and 20\% (543 image subset) as testing. To evaluate the accuracy of methods, the F1 score of the building class was employed. The F1 scores for building class have been calculated as 0.866, 0.860, 0.856, and 0.877 on test images for U-Net Vgg16, U-Net InceptionResNetV2, U-Net DenseNet121, and majority voting method, respectively.},

Focusing on five 2-km2 study areas within the Black Creek sub-watershed of the Humber River, this research uses eCognition® software to develop a rule-based OBIA workflow for semi-automatic classification of impervious land-use features (e.g., roads, buildings, Parking Lots, driveways). The overall classification accuracy ranges from 88.7 to 94.3\%, indicating the effectiveness of using an OBIA approach and developing a sequential system for data fusion and automated impervious feature extraction. Similar accuracy results between the calibrating and validating sites demonstrates the strong potential for the transferability of the rule-set from pilot study sites to a larger area.},

However, there are no standardized, complete and up-to-date databases for many urban areas. Moreover, manual data collection is expensive and time-consuming. Aerial imagery of entire cities can be used to inventory not only publicly accessible and dedicated parking lots, but also roadside parking areas and those on private property. For a realistic estimation of the total parking space, the observed use of multi-functional traffic areas is taken into account by segmenting not only parking areas but also roads according to their purpose. In this paper, different U-Net based architectures are tested for detecting all these types of visible traffic areas. A new large-scale, high-quality dataset of manual annotations is used in combination with selected contextual information from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to depict the actual use as parking space. Our models achieve a good performance on parking area segmentation, and we show the significant impact of OSM data fusion in deep neural networks on the simultaneous extraction of multiple traffic areas compared to using aerial imagery alone. © 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

Compared with the traditional building extraction approaches, deep learning networks have recently shown outstanding performance in this task by using both high-level and low-level feature maps. However, it is difficult to utilize different level features rationally with the present deep learning networks. To tackle this problem, a novel network based on DenseNets and the attention mechanism was proposed, called the dense-attention network (DAN). The DAN contains an encoder part and a decoder part which are separately composed of lightweight DenseNets and a spatial attention fusion module. The proposed encoder–decoder architecture can strengthen feature propagation and effectively bring higher-level feature information to suppress the low-level feature and noises. Experimental results based on public international society for photogrammetry and remote sensing (ISPRS) datasets with only red–green–blue (RGB) images demonstrated that the proposed DAN achieved a higher score (96.16\% overall accuracy (OA), 92.56\% F1 score, 90.56\% mean intersection over union (MIOU), less training and response time and higher-quality value) when compared with other deep learning methods.},

	volume = {36},
	abstract = {Inventory of road infrastructure represents a key application for integrated mobile mapping systems. The classical approach is to post-process geo-referenced imagery that has been captured from mobile mapping vans while driving within the road. Problems arise then within city centres where dense traffic and parking vehicles may often hinder occlusion free image captures of the objects of interest. We present an alternative solution in terms of a mobile PDA based geo-information system for pedestrian based road sign data collection which is targeted towards complementing the classical approach, particularly in city centres. The novel system consists of a mobile computing unit which is equipped with a GPS sensor, a digital camera, a standard mobile GIS software, and a user interface for minimal user intervention. Imagery for road sign inventory is firstly captured and geo-referenced in the street and then analyzed in a second, off-line processing step. We present a post-processing tool for semi-automated classification of road signs, and in parallel an identification of the sub-plate information, strongly supporting the processing of huge data sets, e.g., for the processing of data from complete city areas. The tool includes advanced image analysis methodology with (i) localization of selective key descriptors and regions of interest, (ii) the fitting of geometrical constraints to the extracted set of interest descriptors, and (iii) the matching of content information from the visual information within the sign plate. Text information on the sub-plate is first detected using a wavelet based texture filter, and then post-processed with segmentation operators and standard OCR software. The system has been successfully applied in a project on a complete inventory within the City of Graz, Austria, processing more than 30.000 road signs. The system achieved high accuracy (≈90\%) in the automated image based classification of road signs on more than 20 different road sign classes. © 2007 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

To bridge the gap, we present Grab-Pklot, the first high-resolution and context-enriched satellite imagery dataset for parking lot detection. Our dataset consists of 1344 satellite images with the ground-truth annotations of carparks in Singapore. Motivated by the observation that carparks are mostly co-appear with other geographic objects, we associate each satellite image in our dataset with the surrounding contextual information of road and building, given in the format of multi-channel images. As a side contribution, we present a fusion-based segmentation approach to demonstrate that the parking lot detection accuracy can be improved by modeling the correlations between parking lots and other geographic objects. Experiments on our dataset provide baseline results as well as new insights into the challenges and opportunities in parking lot detection from satellite images.},

Free parking, the author argues, has contributed to auto dependence, rapid urban sprawl, extravagant energy use, and a host of other problems. Planners mandate free parking to alleviate congestion, but end up distorting transportation choices, debasing urban design, damaging the economy, and degrading the environment. Ubiquitous free parking helps explain why our cities sprawl on a scale fit more for cars than for people, and why American motor vehicles now consume one-eighth of the world's total oil production. But it doesn't have to be this way. The author proposes new ways for cities to regulate parking, namely, charge fair market prices for curb parking, use the resulting revenue to pay for services in the neighborhoods that generate it, and remove zoning requirements for off-street parking.},

With the rapid expansion of short-term storage options such as batteries, flexible resources such as existing hydroelectric reservoir storage are often overlooked. Using a capacity expansion and dispatch model of the Northeastern North American power system, we draw lessons from the interconnection potential of Quebec’s large existing hydropower capacities. We find that reservoir-transmission coupling significantly decreases the cost of decarbonization, even when short-term storage costs are low, because it is used for both daily and seasonal balancing. Conversely, the value of short-term storage is compromised by the availability of reservoir-transmission coupling, even assuming high investment costs for transmission. We also describe the regional distribution of costs and benefits of storage and transmission and discuss implications for regional cooperation.},

Imagine that two doctors in the same city give different diagnoses to identical patients?or that two judges in the same courthouse give markedly different sentences to people who have committed the same crime. Suppose that different interviewers at the same firm make different decisions about indistinguishable job applicants?or that when a company is handling customer complaints, the resolution depends on who happens to answer the phone. Now imagine that the same doctor, the same judge, the same interviewer, or the same customer service agent makes different decisions depending on whether it is morning or afternoon, or Monday rather than Wednesday. These are examples of noise: variability in judgments that should be identical. In Noise , Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony, and Cass R. Sunstein show the detrimental effects of noise in many fields, including medicine, law, economic forecasting, forensic science, bail, child protection, strategy, performance reviews, and personnel selection. Wherever there is judgment, there is noise. Yet, most of the time, individuals and organizations alike are unaware of it. They neglect noise. With a few simple remedies, people can reduce both noise and bias, and so make far better decisions. Packed with original ideas, and offering the same kinds of research-based insights that made Thinking, Fast and Slow and Nudge groundbreaking New York Times bestsellers, Noise explains how and why humans are so susceptible to noise in judgment?and what we can do about it."

	abstract = {Cost overrun in rail transit projects in the United States is a pervasive and constant phenomenon, yet there has been a lack of rigorous statistical analysis on project costs. This has been partly due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable cost data and the small size of the sample. In addition, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) has required formal risk assessment on transit projects since 2003. Whether this strategy has improved the accuracy of cost estimates is not known. To fill these gaps, this study has collected the cost data of 81 US rail transit projects built during the last 40 years, the largest sample of its kind. It is found that the accuracy of cost estimates at the decision-making phase has improved over time. Also, major projects have higher percentage cost overruns than smaller projects. Further, the accuracy of cost estimates decrease as project implementation durations increase. The utilized statistical methods yielded no evidence to suggest that cost overruns differ between projects designed before and after 2003, when the FTA risk assessment program started. However, since project size and implementation duration have increased over time, the positive impact of the FTA risk assessment program can be inferred and acknowledged to some extent. This research can serve as a reference point for studies on the accuracy of conceptual cost estimates and help in budgeting future projects. It can also help in understanding the causes of cost overruns in capital projects.},

It leverages a review of existing literature and perceptions of 80 construction professionals purposively to establish the factors affecting cost overruns affecting the UK rail construction sector.

Despite studies providing the essential building blocks and frameworks for cost overrun mitigation and containment, the problem still remains a pervasive issue for Governments worldwide. The interdependency that exists between ‘causes’ that lead to cost overruns materialising have largely been ignored when considering the likelihood and impact of their occurrence. The vast majority of the cost overrun literature has tended to adopt a deterministic approach in examining the occurrence of the phenomenon; in this paper a shift towards the adoption of pluralistic probabilistic approach to cost overrun causation is proposed. The establishment of probabilistic theory incorporates the ability to consider the interdependencies of causes so to provide Governments with a holistic understanding of the uncertainties and risks that may derail the delivery and increase the cost of transportation infrastructure projects. This will further assist in the design of effective mitigation and containment strategies that will ensure future transportation infrastructure projects meet their expected costs as well as the need of taxpayers.},

In contrast to current findings, which show that reference class forecasting leads to more accurate project cost estimates by counteracting human cognitive and organizational biases, this article indicates the contrary, that reference class forecasting does not lead to more accurate cost estimates. The article theorizes that reference class forecasting fails to produce more accurate project cost estimates because estimates are always a relational network effect of human and nonhuman actors’ “biased” efforts to establish them. This finding challenges the existing literature by pointing to a more complex understanding of project cost estimation and biases. The finding is based on a longitudinal case study of a 23.6-billion-kroner Danish public megaproject, which failed to meet its objectives despite the application of reference class forecasting.},

This paper presents results from the first statistically significant study of cost performance in transport infrastructure projects. The sample used is the largest of its kind, covering 258 projects in 20 nations worth approximately US\$90 billion (constant 1995 prices). The paper shows with overwhelming statistical significance that in terms of costs transport infrastructure projects do not perform as promised. The conclusion is tested for different project types, different geographical regions and different historical periods. Substantial cost escalation is the rule rather than the exception. For rail, average cost escalation is 45\% (SD=38), for fixed links (tunnels and bridges) it is 34\% (62) and for roads 20\% (30). Cost escalation appears a global phenomenon, existing across 20 nations on five continents. Cost estimates have not improved and cost escalation not decreased over the past 70 years. Cost estimates used in decision-making for transport infrastructure development are highly, systematically and significantly misleading. Large cost escalations combined with large standard deviations translate into large financial risks. However, such risks are typically ignored or underplayed in decision-making, to the detriment of social and economic welfare.},

Through a review of 41 selected papers, the paper shows that the effectiveness of RCF is mainly applicable to large-scale projects and depends on the definition of the reference class. The paper calls for the development of an empirically based framework for reference class formation and urges the exploration of RCF's adaptability across industries, challenging the current one-size-fits-all approach.

The few studies that do exist show that forecasts of construction costs tend to be underestimated and those of traffic, overestimated. An examination of construction costs and traffic in seven large Danish bridge and tunnel projects indicates that, on average, construction costs were underestimated and traffic was overestimated in the initial phases of planning. This pattern is also found for similar projects in other countries. When the results of all the projects are pooled, it is seen that cost overruns of 50 to 100 percent are common and that overruns above 100 percent are not uncommon. Traffic forecasts that are off by 20 to 60 percent when compared with actual development are frequent in large transportation infrastructure projects. The result of this overoptimism in the initial planning phases is that decisions are based on misleading forecasts that may lead to a misallocation of funds and underperforming projects.},

In reality, the world of policy and project preparation and implementation is a highly stochastic one where things happen only with a certain probability and rarely turn out as originally intended. The failure to reflect the probabilistic reality of investment preparation and implementation is a central reason for the poor track record that can be documented for many major projects. The article describes lessons and recommendations on how to improve accountability in decision making on very large infrastructure investments in Denmark and Germany. The conventional approach to infrastructure investments is replaced by an alternative focusing on accountability. Redrawing the borderlines of private and public involvement, four specific measures to increase accountability are suggested and detailed: (1) Transparency, (2) Performance specifications, (3) Explication of regulatory regimes, and (4) Involvement of risk capital. The decision on whether or not to build a multi-billion dollar fixed link across the Baltic Sea connecting Scandinavia and Germany is used as an illustrative case. The cyclical process about the promotion of the German MAGLEV technology gives another good example for identifying basic failures in the political process. Beyond these examples from two countries, the approach developed is likely to be relevant for other major projects in other countries as well. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Two categories of explanations for cost overruns are distinguished: political explanations and non-political explanations. This paper also investigates whether there are theories that have not yet been included in the literature on cost overruns that can contribute to the understanding of cost overruns. For political explanations agency theory is considered the most interesting and an eclectic theory is considered possible as well. Non-political explanations are diverse in character, therefore a range of different theories (including rational choice theory and prospect theory), dependent on the kind of explanation is considered more appropriate than one all-embracing theory.},

We can return most of their reasons on the bad control of casting process circumstances, including the chemical composition of the metal, pouring speed and temperature, as well as operation processes control. In this research, the breakout heats had been constrained for the period of ten months, for (ST 52) type steel .From the operating data, remarked that most breakout heats was out of the upper limit pouring temperature. Breakout is also appearing to be effect by the chemical composition. Although Manganese percent of the steel was within limits, but it is effect to induce breakout in indirect manner. Increase Silicon content will increase the fluidity of molten steel, leading to increase the ferro-static pressure on solidified shell causing breakout. The increase in Carbon percent has a positive effect in decreasing breakouts. From actual operating effect on breakout, it is found that most breakouts were of first sequence of the heat, which it means that casting preparation was unsuitable. Breakout can be eliminate or avoid by compliance with operation instructions.},

	title = {Steelmaking on {Mars}},
	abstract = {Steel is one of the most widely used materials on Earth, and is likely to be even more valuable on Mars, which lacks wood. Although locally-produced bricks, blocks and cement might initially predominate in construction, their low tensile strength limits what can be manufactured with these materials in the absence of reinforcing steel. Steel will enable fabrication of buildings, parts for vehicles and machinery, beams, pipe, fasteners, tools, sheet metal, cooking implements, appliances, cutlery, and countless other things. The rate at which a martian society can expand will be strongly linked to the rate at which it can produce its own steel. Beyond agriculture, the manufacture of materials, especially steel, will be an important key to self-sufficiency on Mars. Apart from iron ore, the major ingredients normally required for steelmaking are coking coal, limestone, and oxygen-rich air, all of which are in short supply on Mars. However, the basic elements of steel – namely, iron and carbon – are available, which suggests that steel can be manufactured on Mars from local ingredients using new methods. In this paper, various different methods for manufacturing steel on Mars are investigated and compared. Although Mars has abundant quantities of alloying metals with which to produce different types of steel, the paper focuses on plain carbon steel, which is the most common type in use on Earth and will be the easiest to manufacture on Mars. STEELMAKING ON EARTH Composition of Steel Steel is defined as an iron alloy which can be plastically formed. There are many different types of steel, but almost all contain between 0.05\% and 2.1\% carbon, which adds strength and hardness to the steel at the expense of ductility. Alloying elements such as chromium, nickel, magnesium and vanadium are often added to enhance different material properties. Depending on the type of steel, most of the silicon present in the original ore may be removed, or some may be retained. Sulphur and phosphorous are undesired, although small amounts usually remain in the finished product.},

	abstract = {Transport professional process an enormous range of information to help them accurately predict how, when and where people will use the transport system. Yet we know from a long-standing history of psychology research that people draw upon a range of mental shortcuts when making estimates about the world. Ego-centric anchoring and adjustment is a common example of a mental heuristic whereby people draw upon their own beliefs and experiences when estimating the behaviors and attitudes of others. Do transport professionals use ego-centric anchoring when estimating travel patterns? To find out we conducted a survey of transportation professionals (n = 247) who were asked to reveal their own travel patterns and residential location and to estimate the travel patterns of millennials, generation X, and baby boomers. We find that relative to the average American, transportation professionals in the US are more likely to use alternative transport modes and live in more urban neighborhoods. Transportation professionals systematically over-estimate the use of alternative modes (and under-estimate driving) among other Americans. This effect is strongest among transportation professionals who themselves are multi-modal. These results raise a note of caution for transport practitioners and policy-makers to be aware of one's initial ‘anchor’ of personal experience when judging the behavior and desires of the community. For example if practitioners overestimate the proportion of Americans that are already walking, biking, and using transit, they may under-estimate the policy and institutional barriers that have led the majority of Americans to follow the car-dominated path of previous generations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper studies road pricing with reference-dependent preferences, modeled by a linear gain-loss utility function. Given this specification, we find that the socially optimal road toll is smaller than the optimal toll in the absence of reference dependence, and it declines in the degree of loss aversion. Loss aversion can also explain the empirical observation that support for road pricing is lower before than after its introduction. We further show that loss aversion may increase or reduce lobbying efforts by driver organizations against the introduction of tolling. It will increase lobbying if a high toll is proposed but drivers initially believe that the probability that it will be introduced is small. Lastly, loss aversion unambiguously reduces lobbying by organizations of non-drivers (representing, for example, environmentalists or public transport users) in favor of the introduction of a toll.},

Five different labels, based on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) vehicle labels, are designed and tested in a discrete choice experiment considering the combining effects of society goal and individual impacts such as a carbon tax. Using a sample of 2400 car-owning American residents, the EPA’s current framing was tested against these five different framings. To estimate the strength of response, the willingness-to-pay (WTP) was estimated by generating three models, i.e. a conditional logit model, a latent-class logit model with constant assignment, and a latent-class logit model considering socio-demographic and climate change stage of change (CC.SoC) effects. Measurable differences can be observed with respect to the framing type. The most effective framing (WTP of roughly \$280/ton) was found to be where the GHG-E are presented with respect to a societal goal, with the financial impact of having a carbon tax included in the fuel costs. The findings of this research provide an improved solution to increase people’s environmental sensitivity and gives policy suggestions to address the problem of climate change.},

	abstract = {Ecodriving, defined here as the adoption of energy efficient driving styles and practices (primarily moderating accelerations and decelerations, reducing top speeds, and improved maintenance practices), has long been recognized as a potential source of reductions in transportation energy use. Estimates of energy savings attributed to ecodriving range widely, from less than 5\% to as high as 20\% depending on the driving and experimental context. To explore the effects on ecodriving of interaction between drivers and in-vehicle energy feedback, a customized, interactive energy feedback interface was deployed in a field test with real-world drivers. This paper presents the results of interviews with 46 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) drivers who were given the ecodriving feedback interface for a multi-week trial including an interface off (baseline) and on (treatment) condition. This paper relies specifically on self-reports of driver motivations and behaviors to better understand what types of information motivated new ecodriving behavior; a future paper will investigate quantitative fuel consumption effects. Driver interviews at the conclusion of the study revealed that the introduction of feedback led three fourths of drivers to change driving styles to maximize on-road efficiency, at least in the short term. In addition, this study finds that the context of the feedback information, provided by a built-in goal or other contextualizing information such as a comparison value, is important for both comprehension and motivation. Personalization of the information allowed different drivers to access pertinent information, increasing the motivational value of the information. Instantaneous performance feedback such as real-time energy economy or power is used primarily for experimentation and learning of new ecodriving behaviors, whereas average performance feedback is used primarily for goal-setting and goal achievement. In addition, the direct comparison of personalized driver goals and average performance created a game-like experience that encouraged high achievement. Finally, the driver interviews revealed that feedback frames driving as a time to act in an efficient manner.},

	volume = {51},
	shorttitle = {Republic of {Drivers}},
	doi = {10.1353/tech.0.0411},
	abstract = {In Republic of Drivers, Cotten Seiler has delivered a perceptive, wide-ranging, and theoretically sophisticated cultural history of what he calls automobility. Focusing on the period between the establishment of the first American automobile manufacturer and the creation of the interstate highway system, Seiler explores how "a highly specific conception of what it means to be modern and free" came to be so closely associated with the act of driving (p. 2). Drawing on a vast academic literature and a diverse set of cultural texts, he argues that automobility—and particularly the ideas of freedom and autonomy that it embodied—provided a crucial salve for the nation's "narrative of selfhood" during moments when ideas about American individualism were in crisis (p. 3).
Seiler's approach is selective rather than comprehensive, and he structures his book around two distinct periods. The first two chapters examine the "crisis of Republican selfhood" (p. 17) that occurred from 1895 to 1929, when the rise of Frederick Winslow Taylor's principles of scientific management created knotty problems for traditional ideas about the autonomy of white men's work. In this context, workers seeking a new sense of self-worth could escape the indignities of the Taylorized workplace through commodified leisure and a host of new consumer goods, the most extravagant and iconic of which was the automobile.
Nothing, Seiler argues, reinforced the idea of autonomous mastery and control more than the automobile, which American popular culture celebrated as "a force-multiplier of the self, facilitator of a gratifying, thrilling transgression, and a fosterer of self-control" (p. 45), and which appealed to men and women alike. But Seiler argues that the chimera of independence offered by automobiles was more than offset by the opportunities that automobility created for increased surveillance, regulation, and control by the state.
The final three chapters focus on the 1950s, when various thinkers wrestled with troublesome new anxieties about the self, which emerged out of the cold war's rhetorical emphasis on a fight to the death between American "freedom" and the Soviet "collective." In this context, Seiler suggests, the interstate highway act of 1956 was at once both a masterful piece of propaganda for the "American way" and a significant expansion of the federal government's ability to oversee and regulate its citizens' lives. Likewise, the experiences of African-American drivers—who had to rely on specialized travel guides to locate "hospitable roadside lodging, restaurants, and mechanical assistance" (p. 106)—exposed glaring inconsistencies in the rhetorical emphases on the "freedom" of the open road and the potentially transgressive act of driving. Seiler traces these same inconsistencies in the work of the era's highway administrators, who used driving education materials and highly engineered landscapes to encourage, as Seiler puts it, "the capacities of the citizen-driver to govern himself" (p. 133).
Unfortunately, despite its significant insights and broad cross-disciplinary research, this book is unlikely to reach much of an audience beyond scholars in American studies and cultural history. Seiler's writing is a strangemix—lively and engaging prose here, dense and impenetrable academese there—with the result that those who are not well-versed in the theories, ideas, and academic literatures that he draws on seem unlikely to make it much past the book's introduction. Seiler explains "automobility," for example, which is perhaps the single most important term in his book, by referencing "its historicity and its multiple, heterogeneous, intersecting components," and by suggesting "that we comprehend automobility as what Michel Foucault called a dispositif—a concept somewhat impoverished by its English translation to 'formation,' 'grid of intelligibility,' or, the term I will use, 'apparatus'" (p. 5). Republic of Drivers is not, in other words, a casual read, but, for those who are willing and able to make their way through this sort of writing, Seiler makes several incisive and interesting contributions to the existing scholarship on the cultural history of the automobile.

At the same time the freeway revolt has evolved into a more widespread movement, underlined by values such as sustainability. The vigorous debate about the future of urban highways and mobility continues with the development of a fairly recent phenomenon: urban freeway removal. This paper works toward a theory of highway removal by examining three different cases in which urban freeway removal was a seriously considered option-two in which the freeway was removed and replaced with a lower-capacity at-grade boulevard and one in which the freeway ultimately was not removed. The analysis suggests that freeway removal will take place only when (a) the freeway's condition raises concerns about its integrity and safety; (b) a window of opportunity exists, some event that enables a freeway removal alternative to gain serious consideration; (c) the value of mobility is lower than other objectives such as economic development; and (d) those in power value other benefits more than they value the benefits associated with freeway infrastructure.},

Auto Opium is the first comprehensive history of the profession and aesthetics of American automobile design. The author reveals how the appearance of vehicles became an integral part of the system of mass production and mass consumption forged in the struggles of American society. The book traces the development of automobile design, from the first utilitarian cars around the turn of the century to the most modern of symbol-laden cultural icons. The author shows that the aesthetic qualities of vehicles were shaped by the social conflicts generated by the process of mass production. These conflicts became channeled into the realm of mass consumption, where working Americans demanded beautiful, stylish, and constantly improving cars to compensate them for the deprivations of mass production. Creating a unique blend of business, social, and cultural history, Auto Opium connects the social struggles of America to the organizational struggles of designers and the marketplace struggles of firms.},

	abstract = {Automobility refers to the continued, self-perpetuating dominance of privately-owned, gasoline-powered vehicles used primarily by single occupants—a system which clearly has broad environmental and societal impacts. Despite increasing societal interest in transitions to more sustainable transportation technologies, there has been little consideration of how such innovations might challenge, maintain or support different aspects of automobility, and what that means for technology deployment, transport policy, and user practices. To bring attention to the complexity and apparent durability of the automobility system, in this paper we develop a conceptual framework that explores automobility through a categorization of frames, or shared cultural meanings. This framework moves beyond the typical focus on private, functional considerations of user choice, financial costs and time use to also consider symbolic and societal frames of automobility that exist among users, non-users, industry, policymakers and other relevant social groups. We illustrate this framework with eight particular frames of automobility that fall into four broad categories: private-functional frames such as (1) cocooning and fortressing and (2) mobile digital offices; private-symbolic frames such as (3) gender identity and (4) social status; societal-functional frames such as (5) environmental stewardship and (6) suburbanization; and societal-symbolic frames such as (7) self-sufficiency and (8) innovativeness. Finally, we start the process of discussing several transportation innovations in light of these automobility frames, namely electrified, autonomous and shared mobility—examining early evidence for which frames would be challenged or supported by such transitions. We believe that appreciation of the complex and varied frames of automobility can enrich discussion of transitions and policy relating to sustainable transportation. © 2018 The Authors},

In this article, we develop an optimization model for the integrated generation and transmission system in the continental U.S. and use it to explore electricity infrastructure pathways from the present through 2050. By comparing and contrasting results from numerous scenarios and sensitivity settings, we ultimately affirm five key policy-relevant insights. (1) U.S. electricity can be substantially decarbonized at modest cost, but complete decarbonization is very costly. (2) Significant expansion of solar PV and wind to combine for at least 40\% of the generation mix by 2050 is fairly certain, although solar PV and battery storage are more affected by economic and policy assumptions than wind. (3) Investments in long-distance transmission are very limited, while investments in battery storage are much greater, under a wide range of assumptions. (4) Optimal solutions include large investments in natural gas capacity, but gas capacity utilization rates decline steadily and significantly. (5) Cost structures shift away from operating expenditures and toward capital expenditures, especially under climate policy. We conclude our article by discussing the policy implications of these findings.},

Overall, current emission prices will not provide enough incentive to meet stated emission reduction goals. Increases in emission penalties lead to increased transmission capacity. In all cases, the system requires significant dispatchable, low-carbon electricity to meet emission reduction goals and the flexibility of hydro resources provides significant system value.

This relates not just to shopping habits but also to how basic needs such as housing and education are met to understand who gets what, how and why. The systems of provision (SoP) approach emerged in the 1990s in response to a perceived failing in the siloed social sciences to assess adequately the drivers of consumption. The approach proposes an interdisciplinary framing with consumption deemed to be inextricably linked vertically to processes of production as well as (horizontally) to wider contexts. This chapter traces the trajectory of the approach from early studies on the drivers of consumption norms for consumer durables, through analyses of food consumption to more recent applications in social policy and the grander issues of neoliberalism and financialization. The chapter shows that the approach has evolved to cover not just commodity production but also alternative, including public, production and consumption systems. And this adaptability and progress in part explains its durability over the past three decades.},

	url = {https://energie.hec.ca/decarb-camions-longue-dist/},
	abstract = {Pour atteindre l’objectif de carboneutralité du Canada d’ici 2050, il est indispensable de décarboner le secteur des transports, qui représente plus de 20 \% des émissions de gaz à effet de serre (GES) à l’échelle nationale.1 À l’intérieur de ce secteur, la décarbonation des camions lourds de classe 8 utilisés pour le transport de marchandises sur de longues distances constitue un défi de taille, car ils représentent environ 24 \% des émissions globales du secteur des transports et leurs émissions augmentent depuis 1990.
Afin de contribuer au débat sur les technologies carboneutres pour le camionnage longue distance, une simulation d’adoption progressive de quatre technologies carboneutre a été réalisée sur le corridor de l’Autoroute 20 (A20) – Highway 401 (H401) entre les villes de Québec et Windsor. Les camions à 1) batterie électrique; 2) à pile à combustible à hydrogène vert; 3) à caténaires électriques (avec recharge dynamique); et 4) au gaz naturel renouvelable (GNR) comprimé sont comparés sur la base des coûts des véhicules (capital et fonctionnement) et des coûts d’infrastructure (ex., stations de recharge et de ravitaillement). La comparaison est effectuée par rapport à un scénario de référence qui maintient le statu quo (business-as-usual) de l’exploitation de camions au diesel.
Chaque technologie a été évaluée sous deux perspectives : a) la perspective « corridor » qui compare une trajectoire d’adoption progressive pour tous les camions longue distance de classe 8 opérant sur le corridor, avec la transition vers la technologie carboneutre respective d’ici 2050, et b) la perspective « véhicule » qui évalue les coûts totaux du cycle de vie d’un seul camion longue distance de classe 8 au cours de sa durée de vie typique de 10 ans.3 Une analyse de sensibilité a également été réalisée pour tenir compte de l’incertitude et de la variabilité des principaux paramètres de modélisation (ex., prix d’achat des véhicules, prix du carburant et de l’électricité et les coûts d’infrastructure) et pour tester la robustesse des résultats économiques (ex., valeur actuelle nette [VAN], taux de rendement économique [TRE]).
Perspective « corridor »
Dans l’ensemble, les camions électriques à batterie, à caténaires et au GNR ont tous un potentiel de coûts de réduction des GES négatifs, ce qui signifie que des économies peuvent être réalisées en mettant en œuvre ces technologies par rapport aux camions diesel. Cependant, chaque technologie est confrontée à des coûts initiaux élevés pour les véhicules et l’infrastructure avant que les économies de coûts opérationnels en termes de carburant, d’entretien et d’atténuation des émissions de GES (prix du carbone) ne se matérialisent pour compenser l’investissement initial.
En termes d’évaluation strictement économique, les camions au GNR ont tendance à obtenir les meilleurs résultats, avec la valeur actuelle nette (VAN) la plus élevée de 1 606 millions de dollars et un ratio avantages-coûts (RAC) de 2,4 en fonction des hypothèses de base. Or, les camions fonctionnant au GNR continuent à émettre des gaz d’échappement et sont critiqués pour les émissions fugitives en amont liées au stockage et au transport du carburant GNR. En outre, la disponibilité des approvisionnements à grande échelle et les limites de l’offre de GNR durable suscitent des inquiétudes, en particulier si la demande continue d’augmenter dans le secteur des transports et d’autres secteurs (ex., maritime, aviation, bâtiments et industries)4,5. Les camions à batterie électrique (battery electric vehicule [BEV]) (ex aequo avec les camions à caténaires), affichent la deuxième performance la plus favorable, avec un RAC de 1,1 et une VAN positive de 294 millions de dollars. Les économies importantes réalisées sur les coûts de carburant et d’entretien pendant la durée de vie du camion permettent de compenser le prix d’achat plus élevé. Toutefois, l’autonomie, la disponibilité commerciale, le temps de charge et l’infrastructure constituent des obstacles à l’adoption à grande échelle des BEV. Les temps de charge, de l’ordre de plusieurs heures, comparés au temps de ravitaillement en carburant, de l’ordre de quelques minutes, et le poids supplémentaire de la batterie, qui a un impact sur la capacité de charge utile du camion, peuvent poser des problèmes et être source d’inefficacité pour les opérations.
Les camions à caténaires (overhead catenary trucks [OCT]) ont également un RAC de 1,1 et une VAN de 294 millions de dollars. Malgré le coût d’investissement élevé pour la mise en place de l’infrastructure, cet investissement est amorti grâce à des coûts d’exploitation nettement inférieurs. Il existe plusieurs déploiements pilotes réussis de camions à caténaires en Europe et un en Californie, dans le cadre du Clean Transportation Program.6 L’Amérique du Nord accuse un retard par rapport à l’Europe en ce qui a trait à l’utilisation de cette technologie pour le transport routier. Le coût d’investissement initial de l’infrastructure et le manque de banc d’essai pourraient constituer un facteur limitant pour son déploiement sur le corridor autoroutier.
Les camions à pile à combustible à hydrogène vert (fuel cell electric vehicle [FCEV]) n’atteignent pas une VAN positive ou un RAC supérieur à 1. L’utilisation d’hydrogène vert dans le transport lourd accuse un retard sur le rythme de commercialisation à grande échelle face à d’autres technologies, principalement les BEV. Les défis à relever sont notamment le manque d’infrastructures de ravitaillement, le coût élevé de l’hydrogène vert et les prix d’achat élevés pour les nouveaux véhicules, en raison de leur disponibilité limitée en Amérique du Nord. À l’heure actuelle, ces facteurs se traduisent par une logique économique mitigée, mais qui devrait s’améliorer au fur et à mesure que la technologie, les approvisionnements et l’offre d’hydrogène vert vont évoluer.
Perspective « véhicule »
En ce qui a trait aux véhicules, les résultats suggèrent que les camions à caténaires constituent la meilleure option. Cela s’explique par la longévité de l’infrastructure caténaire (lignes aériennes). Le graphique 2 compare le coût total de possession (CTP) de chaque technologie pour un camion individuel sur un cycle de vie de 10 ans, y compris le coût d’infrastructure proportionnel. Les camions propulsés au GNR et au BEV arrivent en deuxième position en termes de coût total de possession, avant les camions diesel. Le FCEV est l’option la plus coûteuse à l’heure actuelle.
Analyse de sensibilité
Une analyse de sensibilité a été réalisée pour évaluer l’influence de différents facteurs sur le prix futur des véhicules et des infrastructures (ex., niveau de maturité technologique, hypothèses sur les exigences en matière d’infrastructure, volatilité des prix de l’énergie, innovations, demande) (voir graphique 10). Globalement, les résultats de la sensibilité sont favorables au GNR, qui a le potentiel d’atteindre un RAC de 4,3 et une VAN de 2,6 milliards de dollars si le prix des camions au GNR diminue de 25 \%. Les camions électriques à batterie et les camions à caténaires montrent également une forte viabilité économique. Les scénarios de flotte BEV sont les plus sensibles au taux d’actualisation, au prix d’achat des camions et au prix du diesel. Les scénarios de flotte à caténaires sont également sensibles à ces paramètres, mais dans une moindre mesure. Enfin, la technologie de l’hydrogène ne permet pas d’obtenir une VAN positive ou un RAC supérieur à 1. Le scénario le plus favorable est celui où le prix de l’hydrogène vert diminue de 50 \% par rapport au prix utilisé dans le scénario de base.
Émissions de GES évitées et demande d’énergie
Compte tenu des projections actuelles de la demande de transport longue distance de classe 8 sur le corridor
A20-H401, les émissions de GES évitées par la mise en œuvre d’un scénario net zéro sont de l’ordre de 2,8
Mt CO2e/an à l’horizon 2050. La demande totale d’énergie pour la flotte de camions est estimée à environ
4,2 PJ (scénario GNR), 261 millions de kg (scénario hydrogène vert) et entre 3 et 4 TWh (scénarios caténaire et BEV)
(voir tableau 21). D’autres études sont nécessaires pour déterminer les incidences sur la demande d’énergie.
Limites
Le rapport présente de manière transparente plusieurs limites qui pourraient servir de base à l’approfondissement
de cette étude dans le cadre de travaux futurs. Il s’agit notamment d’une analyse plus détaillée des besoins et
des coûts en infrastructures, d’une évaluation plus large des flux du réseau de fret (ex., les routes secondaires
liées au corridor A20-H401), de la prévision des prix futurs des véhicules, des carburants et de l’électricité, et
de l’inclusion d’autres avantages non économiques tels que le bruit et la pollution de l’air. Il faut reconnaître
que chaque technologie évaluée peut présenter des avantages uniques pour la décarbonation de différents
segments du marché du transport routier longue distance. Au fur et à mesure que des données additionnelles
seront disponibles et que les paramètres et coûts des véhicules et infrastructures vont s’améliorer, il sera justifié
de réexaminer l’analyse du transport routier longue distance et d’élargir l’analyse afin d’y inclure des données et
informations notées comme étant des limites dans cette étude.},

	abstract = {In July 2019, the UK Government revised its Climate Change Act (2008) to mandate net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. This is an ambitious, but essential objective requiring sweeping changes across the whole of the UK’s energy system. It means that the UK needs a full- range of robust and cost-effective, zero-GHG energy system technologies, covering electricity generation, heat, industry, transport and agriculture: implemented from the early 2020’s onward. Land-based freight is an essential service sector, vital to the prosperity of the UK; however, it is also a significant source of GHG and noxious emissions. Within domestic freight, Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) carry 90\% of the UK’s goods lifted (DfT, 2018a). A zero-emissions alternative to the traditional diesel-powered HGV is vital if the UK is to achieve its net-zero carbon ambition.
The UK’s economy has been hit by an unprecedented economic downturn due to the COVID-19 crisis. 
As the Government assesses the damage and considers policies that can stimulate investment and jobs, this White Paper presents an opportunity to align these two goals: electrifying our major roads to quickly and cost-effectively decarbonise HGVs. An ‘Electric Road System’ (ERS) is the primary candidate to deliver the energy needed by the UK’s long-distance HGV fleet. ERS deploys roadside infrastructure that allows the most efficient direct use of zero-carbon electricity and hence the lowest societal cost. This approach is scalable and quick to deploy, using known and available technologies, existing delivery bodies such as National Grid, Highways England and the UK’s construction industry and infrastructure supply chains: creating significant employment. Truck manufacturers including Scania have indicated they can deliver the modified vehicles and have delivered numerous prototypes for demonstration trials around Europe. This White Paper sets out the case for a nationwide rollout of ERS through the 2030s. A total investment in the region of £19.3 billion would be required to electrify almost all the UK’s long-haul freight vehicles, corresponding to 65\% of road freight movements. The estimated CO2 saving would be 13.4 MtCO2e per annum, along with substantial air quality benefits. The remaining 35\% of freight movements are mainly urban deliveries that are expected to move to battery electric lorries over the next 10 years. The investment compares well with the size of other planned infrastructure projects. Work could get underway immediately with an £80 million pilot project in the North East of England.
What is an Electric Road System?
There are several forms of ERS including conductive and inductive systems. The most mature and cost-effective technology is the overhead catenary system, which is the focus of this paper. Figure i shows an overhead catenary installed on a German motorway. There are four such demonstrations underway on public roads across Germany and Sweden that have demonstrated the feasibility of the
approach, with a further demonstration being planned in Italy.
The overhead catenary system is a mature and safe technology (commonplace in the railway sector) that consists of a supporting structure built outside the road boundary that holds two catenary cable systems. These wires supply the positive and negative electrical circuit that is picked up through a pantograph collector on the roof of the HGV. The pantograph can be rapidly connected and disconnected automatically as needed. The HGV is free to leave the wires to overtake or complete its journey away from the catenary using a separate on-board battery (approximately the size of an electric car battery), providing zero tailpipe emissions at all times. Any existing or future propulsion technology is compatible with the overhead catenary approach. Indeed, during the transition period it is anticipated that hybrid vehicles will combine catenary power with diesel, bio-gas or hydrogen fuel cells to ensure the necessary operational flexibility.
How could zero-emission electric HGVs become a reality in the UK?
The ‘UK Electric Motorway System’ (UKEMS) project will build the necessary infrastructure across the UK’s road network. It is proposed that this is achieved through a four-phase programme. Starting with an £80 million pilot project, leveraging the lessons learnt in Sweden, Germany and Italy, to look at the policy, taxation, and implementation issues specific to the UK. The proposed 40 lane-km South Yorkshire pilot needs to be completed by 2025, so that the main three-phase rollout of the infrastructure can begin. Each of the construction phases of the rollout would take 2-3 years plus associated time for planning, design, procurement, etc. Example rollout phases with estimated costs are shown in Figure ii. The total cost of the final network is estimated to be £19.3 billion and covers approximately 65\% of all the HGV-kms in the UK. By using battery electric power to travel to and from the network and for urban operations, a very high level of decarbonisation of the road freight sector would be achieved as the carbon intensity of the electricity grid reduces.
Roll-out of the roadside infrastructure could be made even more cost-effective by combining it with other road infrastructure projects such as the intelligent transport systems needed to support connected and autonomous vehicles as well as the 5G network: thus, sharing costs and providing the UK with world-class digital transport and communications infrastructure. With upfront planning, part of the backbone electrical infrastructure could also be shared with cars and vans, through charging points located at motorway services. Much of the cost of high-power motorway-based charging infrastructure for cars is spent getting sufficient electrical power to the roadside, often directly from the National Grid (or devolved equivalent). By sharing this cost between cars and HGVs, the investment risk will be lowered and construction-related disruption reduced.
How would the system pay for itself and generate revenue for HM Treasury?
This paper shows that profitable business models are possible for the vehicle operators and infrastructure providers and that energy sales can generate substantial revenue for HM Treasury. This is a result of the inherent energy efficiency and low economic costs of operating electric lorries. The investment in pantograph-electric vehicles by fleet operators could pay back within 18 months (due to lower energy costs), with substantial headroom to raise revenue through increased electricity excise tax for the government. Investment in electrification infrastructure: catenary cables, substations, etc., could pay back in 15 years, using the profit margin on electricity sales to vehicles. The system would be entirely self-sustaining and could be built and operated using private finance.
Summary
Overhead catenaries and compatible HGV’s are the most energy-efficient and cost-effective solution to fully decarbonise the UK’s road freight network. Their deployment is essential if the UK is to achieve its Carbon budgets through to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. The technology is proven and the transition from the current diesel-centric approach to catenary-powered electric vehicles can be handled with hybrid vehicles. The infrastructure investment can also be partly shared with other investments such as motorway service station charging of cars, the 5G network and the intelligent transport system infrastructure needed to support connected and autonomous vehicles of the future. The investments in pantograph electric vehicles would pay-back the vehicle operators in 18 months (through lower energy costs) and the electrification infrastructure could pay-back its investors in 15 years (through electricity sales). This makes the infrastructure investment a unique opportunity for private finance. The improved energy efficiency of the freight system will also create sufficient headroom in the economics for substantial government revenues through an electricity excise tax, road user charge or some other form of tax.
This paper shows that under some reasonable pricing scenarios, the revenues could be sufficient to entirely replace the current fuel tax levied on HGVs. In addition, reduced dependence on energy imports would strengthen the UK economy and national energy security. A three-phase implementation plan is presented with an estimated total cost of £19.3 billion, completing in the late 2030s. A preliminary phase is proposed, consisting of an £80 million UK-specific pilot project to prove the efficacy of the approach and remove all uncertainties. This paper seeks support for the catenary approach and the launching of the pilot project.},

	abstract = {The built environment is thought to influence travel demand along three principal dimensions —density, diversity, and design. This paper tests this proposition by examining how the ‘3Ds’ affect trip rates and mode choice of residents in the San Francisco Bay Area. Using 1990 travel diary data and land-use records obtained from the U.S. census, regional inventories, and field surveys, models are estimated that relate features of the built environment to variations in vehicle miles traveled per household and mode choice, mainly for non-work trips. Factor analysis is used to linearly combine variables into the density and design dimensions of the built environment. The research finds that density, land-use diversity, and pedestrian-oriented designs generally reduce trip rates and encourage non-auto travel in statistically significant ways, though their influences appear to be fairly marginal. Elasticities between variables and factors that capture the 3Ds and various measures of travel demand are generally in the 0.06 to 0.18 range, expressed in absolute terms. Compact development was found to exert the strongest influence on personal business trips. Within-neighborhood retail shops, on the other hand, were most strongly associated with mode choice for work trips. And while a factor capturing ‘walking quality’ was only moderately related to mode choice for non-work trips, those living in neighborhoods with grid-iron street designs and restricted commercial parking were nonetheless found to average significantly less vehicle miles of travel and rely less on single-occupant vehicles for non-work trips. Overall, this research shows that the elasticities between each dimension of the built environment and travel demand are modest to moderate, though certainly not inconsequential. Thus it supports the contention of new urbanists and others that creating more compact, diverse, and pedestrian-orientated neighborhoods, in combination, can meaningfully influence how Americans travel.},

	title = {Décarbonation du transport lourd de marchandises : {Construire} une voie durable},
	url = {https://cdn-contenu.quebec.ca/cdn-contenu/adm/org/comite-consultatif-changements-climatiques/avis/decarbonation-transport-lourd.pdf},
	abstract = {Le système actuel de mobilité des marchandises n’est pas orienté vers l’efficacité énergétique et encore moins vers l’atteinte de la carboneutralité. À défaut d’une réorientation fondamentale de ce système vers une décarbonation profonde, il ne sera pas possible de respecter les objectifs climatiques à l’horizon 2050. Entre 1990 et 2021, les émissions des véhicules lourds ont augmenté de 44 \% alors que les émissions totales du Québec ont diminué de 8,1 \%. Cette situation est due notamment à la croissance du secteur du camionnage, soutenue par des investissements dans les infrastructures routières qui viennent renforcer son avantage comparatif, et à la faiblesse des gains en matière d’efficacité énergétique. Le Comité constate de surcroît un déficit d’initiatives de décarbonation du transport de marchandises, alors que ces émissions augmentent beaucoup plus rapidement que la population. 
Pour relever le défi de la décarbonation du secteur du transport lourd, le Comité préconise le respect de la séquence Réduire, Transférer, Améliorer. Après l’examen des moyens mis en œuvre pour décarboner letransport de marchandises, le Comité constate que l’assortiment de mesures du gouvernement du Québec vise, pour l’essentiel, l’amélioration sans changement structurel. À l’inverse de la situation actuelle, le gouvernement du Québec doit agir pour réduire la demande globale de transport et doit prioritairement concentrer ses prochaines initiatives pour transférer une partie de la demande de transport routier par camion vers le train et le bateau. En effet, pour le même kilomètre parcouru et la même tonne de marchandises transportées avec les moteurs diesels utilisés aujourd’hui, le transport maritime et le transport ferroviaire émettent respectivement 86 \% et 92 \% moins de GES en moyenne que le transport routier. 
La première recommandation du Comité est d’instaurer dans les meilleurs délais une contribution kilométrique pour le transport routier de marchandises. Une hausse substantielle de l’écofiscalité dans le secteur du transport routier de marchandises devrait financer des mesures de transfert modal. L’augmentation du signal-prix permettrait de mieux refléter le coût des externalités du transport routier, au premier chef celui associé aux émissions de GES. 
Pour transférer la demande de transport, le Comité propose notamment de mettre en œuvre sur l’ensemble du territoire une stratégie ferroviaire québécoise axée sur la décarbonation. Cette stratégie devrait être arrimée à la mise en œuvre de la Politique nationale de l’architecture et de l’aménagement du territoire (PNAAT), par exemple en prévoyant des emplacements réservés autant à des centres logistiques multimodaux qu’au déploiement d’embranchements ferroviaires additionnel. Prioriser le transfert modal produirait des cobénéfices pour l’ensemble de la société québécoise, y compris le Trésor public. Dans un contexte de pénurie de main-d’œuvre, pour transporter le même poids de marchandises, un membre d’équipage de bateau peut remplacer environ 35 conducteurs de poids lourds, tandis qu’un opérateur de train peut en remplacer environ 100. De plus, le transport de marchandises par camion génère 3,2 fois plus de coûts pour la collectivité (accidents, troubles respiratoires et cardiaques, adaptation climatique, congestion et dégradation des routes) que le transport par rail et 2,2 plus que le transport maritime. 
Pour réduire la demande de transport, il importe d’agir dès aujourd’hui afin d’entamer un virage à long terme. Le Comité propose notamment d’adopter une feuille de route pour le développement de l’économie circulaire et de promouvoir la sobriété dans les choix de consommation et de production. Des actions devraient également être prévues pour façonner des pôles de déplacements du transport des marchandises qui contribuent à la décarbonation. 
Les actions d’amélioration, qui représente la troisième priorité de la séquence RTA, ne peuvent être à elles seules une réponse adéquate à la nécessaire décarbonation du transport des marchandises. Compte tenu d’importantes limitations technologiques et des autres besoins énergétiques, les mesures d’électrification des camions devraient viser en priorité les besoins de déplacements sur de courtes et moyennes distances, soit inférieures à 200 km. Des efforts massifs devraient être consacrés à la réduction des besoins de déplacements et au transfert modal. Si des mesures substantielles ne sont pas mises en œuvre en ce sens, les coûts publics et privés des options d’amélioration seront plus élevés pour les contribuables et les consommateurs.
La trajectoire des émissions de GES du transport lourd de marchandises devra évoluer de la forte croissance des dernières décennies, à une diminution pour ultimement atteindre un niveau d’émission net zéro à l’horizon 2050. Cet énorme défi nécessitera une action publique structurante pour construire les infrastructures et orienter les choix de consommation vers des produits et des chaînes de distribution qui réduisent au minimum les émissions de GES. Dans cette perspective, le Comité formule les cinq recommandations suivantes :
1. Instaurer, dans les meilleurs délais, une contribution kilométrique dans le transport routier de marchandises ;
2. Mettre en œuvre une stratégie ferroviaire et maritime favorisant un important transfert modal ;
3. Prioriser le transport de courte et de moyenne distance dans les efforts d’amélioration du transport de marchandises ;
4. Adopter une feuille de route sur le développement de  ’économie circulaire pour contribuer à la réduction de la demande de transport ;
5. Accroître la capacité de planification et de réglementation du gouvernement du Québec en décarbonation du transport.},

An assessment of new technologies including alternative transport fuels to break the dependence on petroleum is presented, although it appears that technological innovation is unlikely to be the sole answer to the climate change problem. To achieve a stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions from transport, behavioural change brought about by policy will also be required. Pressure is growing on policy makers to tackle the issue of climate change with a view to providing sustainable transport. Although, there is a tendency to focus on long-term technological solutions, short-term behavioural change is crucial if the benefits of new technology are to be fully realised.},

Crucially, our effort exceeds previous attempts in terms of dataset size, annotation richness, scene variability, and complexity. Our accompanying empirical study provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, as well as a performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark.},

Aerial images provide valuable information over a large area instantaneously; nevertheless, no current dataset captures the complexity of aerial scenes at the level of granularity required by real-world applications. To address this, we introduce SkyScapes, an aerial image dataset with highly-accurate, fine-grained annotations for pixel-level semantic labeling. SkyScapes provides annotations for 31 semantic categories ranging from large structures, such as buildings, roads and vegetation, to fine details, such as 12 (sub-)categories of lane markings. We have defined two main tasks on this dataset: dense semantic segmentation and multi-class lane-marking prediction. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate state-of-the-art segmentation methods on SkyScapes. Existing methods struggle to deal with the wide range of classes, object sizes, scales, and fine details present. We therefore propose a novel multi-task model, which incorporates semantic edge detection and is better tuned for feature extraction from a wide range of scales. This model achieves notable improvements over the baselines in region outlines and level of detail on both tasks.},

	abstract = {Together, globalisation and urbanisation are accelerating the densification of cities while disruptive technologies such as micro-mobility and ride-hailing are transforming urban mobility. Amidst this change, urban planning officials and practitioners typically remain constrained to the same urban footprint, left to grapple with earlier car-oriented development, and yet must accommodate a growing population and variety of travel modes operating within the same space. Further, they must operate alongside government officials whose re-election could depend upon appeasing suburban residents that are unable or unwilling to relocate along active transport corridors, near public transit nodes, or forgo the flexibility and comfort of private automobiles. As a result, private automobiles can become necessary for traversing urban forms already enlarged by parking, driveways, roads, highways, and flyovers. Likewise, alternatives such as public and active transport can become impractical and dangerous within urban forms that are fragmented by congestion or fast traffic. Given that urban mobility research typically focuses on keeping our pre-existing modal choices moving rather than the side-effects, daily commutes have remained unchanged for decades, and planners are better equipped to continually accommodate rather than influence our modal choices. This volume of Progress in Planning aims to strengthen the evidence base for influencing modal choice by developing a comparative framework of urban mobility, and by examining how parking policy has influenced modal choice within the three largest Australian cities: Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne. In addition, it provides reproducible methods for estimating parking supply using land use audits, parking demand using a population census, and geo-statistical modelling for determining whether and where parking policy can explain more sustainable modal choices. As such, this volume sets a research agenda for metropolitan-scale examination and coordination of transport and land use planning for sustainable rather than temporary urban mobility.},

In this study, we collected and analyzed person and motorized vehicle count data from 26 affordable housing developments in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Counts were regressed upon site and built environment characteristics known to influence site-level travel behavior (e.g., parking supply, employment density), and regressions were validated using externally collected data. The findings indicate the average square footage of dwelling units, parking ratios, and nearby retail employment densities to be important predictors. The findings also indicate that increasing the parking supply from one space to two for each dwelling unit will result in a significant predicted increase of approximately 0.26 and 0.18 motorized vehicle trips per dwelling unit for AM and PM peak periods, respectively. These findings reiterate the need for trip generation methodologies sensitive to the built environment and sociodemographics.},

	abstract = {Despite the potential of congestion pricing to ease the nation’s ever-increasing congestion problems, there is little quantitative evidence of its ability to spread peak travel demand more efficiently over the course of the day. The objective of the present work is to assess the impact of variable pricing on the temporal distribution of demand to investigate further the role of variable pricing as a travel demand management tool. The Variable Pricing Program of Lee County, Florida, was used as the data source for the study. Because of the limited congestion experienced at the program location, the effects of travel cost changes on the temporal distribution of demand could be isolated. It was found that program implementation had a minimal impact on the overall distribution of demand. Demand for peak-period travel remained relatively unaltered, and active peak spreading was not observed. At the more disaggregate level, however, the impact of the program was more apparent, with significant temporal shifts in the proportion of demand within individual half-hour time segments. Further analysis revealed a price elasticity relationship that was consistent with that in the existing literature. A relationship was also observed between the extent of preprogram peak spreading and the subsequent percent reduction in peak-period travel demand after program implementation. This finding suggests the potential to predict the active peak spreading that may result from congestion pricing. The fact that substantial temporal shifts in travel demand were observed in response to a discount of only 25 cents highlights the potential of variable pricing as a travel demand management tool.},

	abstract = {Despite the widespread harm caused by cars and automobility, governments, corporations, and individuals continue to facilitate it by expanding roads, manufacturing larger vehicles, and subsidising parking, electric cars, and resource extraction. This literature review synthesises the negative consequences of automobility, or car harm, which we have grouped into four categories: violence, ill health, social injustice, and environmental damage. We find that, since their invention, cars and automobility have killed 60–80 million people and injured at least 2 billion. Currently, 1 in 34 deaths are caused by automobility. Cars have exacerbated social inequities and damaged ecosystems in every global region, including in remote car-free places. While some people benefit from automobility, nearly everyone—whether or not they drive—is harmed by it. Slowing automobility's violence and pollution will be impracticable without the replacement of policies that encourage car harm with policies that reduce it. To that end, the paper briefly summarises interventions that are ready for implementation.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.tra.2021.04.012},
	abstract = {Where traffic is congested and all the curb spaces are occupied, some drivers are probably cruising for parking. Cities can eliminate this cruising by charging demand-based prices for curb parking to ensure one or two open spaces on every block. Drivers will then usually find convenient places to park within a short walk of their destinations. But if cities charge demand-based prices for curb parking, how will drivers choose where to park, and what will they pay? To answer these questions, I have examined how four variables—parking duration, number of persons in the car, walking speed, and value of saving time spent walking—determine parking choices when prices increase as drivers approach their destinations. Short-term parkers, carpools, slow walkers, and drivers with a high value of saving time will park closer to their destinations. Long-term parkers, solo drivers, fast walkers, and drivers with a low value of saving time will park farther away. This spontaneous, self-organizing pattern of parking choices responding to demand-based parking prices will minimize the collective cost of the time drivers spend walking to and from their destinations. Demand-priced curb parking will also reduce uncertainty about travel times. Drivers delayed by traffic congestion can save time at the end of their trips by paying a higher price to park closer to their destinations. Demand-priced curb parking at the end of a trip can serve as a buffer allowing late-arriving drivers to buy time when they need it most. © 2021 The Author(s)},

For every person born since the 1950s, one tonne of plastic has been produced and less than a tenth of this has been recycled. Around half the amount of plastic waste we produce globally is packaging that is used just once. This report describes the environmental destruction, sickness, mortality, and damage to livelihoods that the plastic pollution crisis is causing. It outlines the problem – namely the huge recent increase in the production and distribution of single-use plastics, and its expansion across the globe to countries lacking the capacity to collect, manage and recycle waste. And it spells out the solutions. Current trajectories point to increased illness and unnecessary deaths, further harm to livelihoods and greater destruction of our environment. But it doesn’t have to be this way. In this report we outline the roles and responsibilities of four groups we believe to be key to tackling the plastic pollution crisis: multinational consumer goods companies who drive the production of single-use plastic packaging, and currently do little to collect and sustainably manage the waste they have created; developed country governments who have enabled and incentivised a ‘throwaway’ culture and whose response to the crisis in developing countries has so far been weak; developing country governments whose citizens are the most severely impacted by the crisis; citizens who can show that there is an overwhelming demand for change.},

	abstract = {A discussion is presented of the ways in which accessibility to employment and urban services constitute an important measure of the quality of urban living, and how accessibility might, therefore, be included as an important component of a “social report” for a city or region. A conceptual framework is introduced for measuring accessibility in terms of the ease with which citizens may reach a variety of opportunities for employment and services. This framework is interpreted as an approach to evaluating transportation and regional plans which differs from approaches based upon travel volumes and travel times which are currently employed in urban transportation planning and evaluation. The use of the proposed measures of accessibility is illustrated with data on accessibility to employment and health care facilities in Los Angeles, and these data are interpreted to illustrate differences in accessibility as a function of spatial location of residence, and socio-economic status.},

	abstract = {Transport Justice develops a new paradigm for transportation planning based on principles of justice. Author Karel Martens starts from the observation that for the last fifty years the focus of transportation planning and policy has been on the performance of the transport system and ways to improve it, without much attention being paid to the persons actually using - or failing to use - that transport system. There are far-reaching consequences of this approach, with some enjoying the fruits of the improvements in the transport system, while others have experienced a substantial deterioration in their situation. The growing body of academic evidence on the resulting disparities in mobility and accessibility, have been paralleled by increasingly vocal calls for policy changes to address the inequities that have developed over time. Drawing on philosophies of social justice, Transport Justice argues that governments have the fundamental duty of providing virtually every person with adequate transportation and thus of mitigating the social disparities that have been created over the past decades. Critical reading for transport planners and students of transportation planning, this book develops a new approach to transportation planning that takes people as its starting point, and justice as its end.},

	shorttitle = {Investigation of an {Apple} {Supplier}},
	url = {https://chinalaborwatch.org/investigation-of-an-apple-supplier-chengdu-foxconn-report-in-2023/},
	abstract = {In November 2020, China Labor Watch (CLW) reported on a protest held by over 1,000 dispatch workers at Foxconn Chengdu. Foxconn’s dispatch workers were owed three month’s worth of hourly subsidies and bonuses, but Foxconn itself did not actually sign any labor contracts with the workers, effectively shrugging off responsibility. This ignited protests and concerns over labor conditions at Apple’s largest Chinese supplier. CLW interviews uncovered a series of labor rights violations, including forced overtime, recruitment discrimination, and sexual harassment. 

Foxconn’s Chengdu factory is one of Apple’s main sourcing sites. Each fall when Apple releases a new line of products, workers labor around the clock to meet impossible production targets. Dispatch workers, or workers who do not directly sign labor contracts with factories but instead are outsourced by labor dispatch companies, make up approximately half of the workforce. The precarious nature of their employment makes them extremely susceptible to abuse. While Apple has gained a reputation for excellent product quality and customer service through its ‘AppleCare’ and ‘Genius Bar’ services, its reputation for labor rights is considerably less stellar. Despite Apple’s claims of having high standards when it comes to corporate social responsibility, year after year, serious labor rights violations occur on the factory floor.

From June to July 2023, CLW sent an investigator to Foxconn’s Chengdu factory to document the working conditions of Apple’s global supply chain. CLW’s investigation discovered that the problems uncovered in 2020 still exist in the factory. To this day, Foxconn Chengdu enforces a large number of illegal labor practices including the excessive use of dispatch workers, mandatory overtime, workplace bullying and harassment, and recruitment discrimination.

As a leading non-governmental advocacy organization for Chinese worker rights and labor rights, CLW strongly condemns the conditions at Foxconn’s Chengdu factory. As Foxconn’s client, Apple has failed to fulfill its responsibility to create a safe and fair working environment. CLW demands that Foxconn Chengdu and Apple respond publicly, correct the illegal practices, and compensate the exploited workers who were harmed in the production of Apple products.},

	abstract = {Une étude basée sur une méthodologie rigoureuse qui évalue l’impact environnemental du numérique dans son ensemble. Le Gouvernement a confié, le 6 août 2020, la réalisation d’une étude conjointe à  l’Agence de la transition écologique (ci-après « ADEME ») et à l’Arcep sur l’évaluation de l’impact environnemental du numérique en France. 
Aujourd hui, l’état de l’art dans ce domaine présente des études aux méthodologies peu harmonisées, peu transparentes et n’abordant l’impact environnemental du numérique que partiellement, via la seule évaluation de son empreinte carbone. L’objet de cette étude est donc de répondre au besoin d’une évaluation plus complète.
Pour ce faire, l’étude retient une approche d’analyse de cycle de vie (ACV) qui se base sur des normes et référentiels publics spécifiques et les plus complets possible afin d’avoir :
- un périmètre plus englobant via une décomposition du numérique en trois briques matérielles que sont les terminaux, les réseaux et les centres de données (c’est l’aspect multi-composants de l’ACV),
- une évaluation de l’impact environnemental du numérique via 11 indicateurs environnementaux supplémentaires en plus de son empreinte carbone (c’est l’aspect multicritères de l’ACV),
- une analyse qui intègre les impacts générés lors de toutes les étapes du cycle de vie de chacune de ces trois briques à savoir les phases de fabrication, distribution, utilisation et fin de vie (c’est l’aspect multi-étapes de l’ACV).
Selon cette approche et en l’état des données recueillies par les prestataires, il ressort que :
- des trois briques qui constituent le périmètre de l’étude, ce sont les terminaux (et en particulier les écrans et téléviseurs) qui sont à l’origine de 65 à 90 \% de l’impact environnemental, selon l’indicateur environnemental considéré, 
- à côté des impacts environnementaux liés à la consommation énergétique (incluant entre autres l’empreinte carbone, les radiations ionisantes et l’épuisement des ressources abiotiques fossiles qui décrivent environ 64 \% de l’impact) qui sont des impacts communs à de nombreux secteurs, l’épuisement des ressources abiotiques naturelles (minéraux \& métaux) ressort comme un critère pertinent pour décrire (de l’ordre de 27 \%) l’impact environnemental du numérique,
- de toutes les étapes du cycle de vie des biens et services considérées, la fabrication et l’utilisation concentrent souvent jusqu’à 100 \% de l’impact environnemental.
Par ailleurs l’étude permet également une analyse à un niveau de granularité plus fin au sein de chacune des briques dont les résultats sont présentés par la suite. Cette étude permet donc d’affiner l’évaluation de l’impact environnemental du numérique, d’apprécier concrètement la complexité de l’exercice et d’identifier les obstacles les plus structurants à lever afin d’améliorer la mesure},

For ICT's future emissions, we explore assumptions underlying analysts' projections to understand the reasons for their variability. All analysts agree that ICT emissions will not reduce without major concerted efforts involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring intervention and find that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets. We explore the underdevelopment of policy mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance, and contend that, without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep the ICT sector's footprint aligned with the Paris Agreement.},

	abstract = {There is no question that smartphones, PCs, and other computing devices have changed the world and our day-to-day lives in incredible ways But behind this innovative21st-century technology lie supply chain and manufacturing processes still reliant on 19th-century sources of energy, dangerous mining practices, hazardous chemicals, and poorly designed products that drive consumption of the Earth’s resources This hidden reality stands in stark contrast to the forward-thinking, environmentally conscious image most IT companies project Greenpeace launched the Rethink-IT campaign to challenge the IT sector to take responsibility for its rapidly growing footprint on the planet The Guide to Greener Electronics (the Guide, published by Greenpeace USA) provides an analysis of what 17 of the world’s
leading consumer electronics companies are doing to address their environmental impacts, and where Greenpeace thinks work still needs to be done From 2006 to 2012, Greenpeace published the Guide with regularity, and as a result saw steady progress from companies to eliminate hazardous materials
from products and make them more energy-efficient Now, it is clear the impacts of the linear take-make-waste business model employed by device manufacturers extend beyond the
concerns of hazardous e-waste.
With the relaunch of the Guide, we have focused on measuring three critical impact areas tied to product design and responsible supply chain management across the electronics sector:
{\textbar}{\textbar} Energy: Reduction of greenhouse gases through efficiency and renewable energy
{\textbar}{\textbar} Resource Consumption: sustainable design and use of recycled materials
{\textbar}{\textbar} Chemicals: Elimination of hazardous chemicals from both the product itself and manufacturing
Within each impact area, companies are graded on transparency, commitment, performance and advocacy efforts In this edition of the Guide we have focused on the largest electronic device brands (smartphones, tablets, and personal computers) in East Asia, North America, and Europe
Time to Re-Think IT
Mining for essential and finite raw materials often endangers workers and leaves the Earth irreversibly scarred Coal-powered manufacturing contributes to rising global temperatures and the devastating impacts of climate change 
The companies that are designing and manufacturing our devices must take into account the significant impacts they are having on our planet and the increasing demand from the public to define innovation not by fewer millimeters and more megapixels, but by how they are made—with renewable
energy, reusable materials, and long-lasting design. 
Billions of electronics are being made, sold, and disposed of every year—a cycle that drives short-term profits for electronics manufacturers, but at too high a cost for the planet we all share
Resolving the pollution problems created along the complex supply chain will not happen overnight, but it must begin at once Fortunately, disrupting the status quo is nothing new to the IT sector Now is the time for the tech sector to channel its expertise into reinventing the way that electronic devices
are made and used in society, to reverse the ever-increasing consumption of the planet’s finite resources and reliance on fossil fuels, creating a circular and renewably powered business model that other sectors can follow 

Major Findings
{\textbar}{\textbar} Lack of transparency in supply chain: Despite representing the majority of the environmental footprint
for most electronic manufacturers, most companies publish little information on their suppliers, keeping their environmental performance and impacts hidden from view. Of the 17 companies evaluated, only six publish a basic list of suppliers and only Fairphone and Dell provide details on the products or services from each supplier Among the top 3 brands in the global smartphone market, Huawei is the only brand reporting nothing about its supply chain greenhouse gas emissions 
{\textbar}{\textbar} Supply chain driving demand for dirty energy: Upwards of 70 to 80\% of the carbon footprint during the lifespan of personal computing devices occurs during manufacturing Despite impressive progress a number of companies have made in starting the transition of their offices and data centers to renewable energy, nearly all of the companies have yet to address the rapidly growing carbon footprint and dependence on dirty energy in their supply chains Apple is the only company thus far that has committed to 100\% renewable power for its supply chain Estimated GHG emissions (both own operations and supply chain) for the 17 companies in this guide were more than 103 million
metric tons of Co2e in 2016, or roughly the same level emissions for the Czech Republic in one year
{\textbar}{\textbar} Samsung lagging on renewable energy: Samsung is both the largest manufacturer of smartphones worldwide and a supplier of key components to many of the other brands in the Guide, yet the company is holding the sector back by failing to tackle its climate change responsibility by
committing to 100\% renewable energy for its operations The company used more than 16,000 GWh of energy in 2016, with just 1\% coming from renewables 
{\textbar}{\textbar} Chinese smartphone brands gaining global market share, but losing in green commitment: Chinese
smartphone manufacturers, Huawei, Oppo and Xiaomi together occupied over a quarter of the global smartphone market share in quarter two of 2017 1 However, they score below average in all three impact areas, especially lacking transparency and substantial commitment in renewable energy Huawei, now one of the top 3 smartphone brands in the world, has yet to realize its tremendous potential in environmental leadership
{\textbar}{\textbar} Amazon remains one of the least transparent: Amazon remains one of the least transparent companies in the world in terms of its environmental performance, as it still refuses to report the greenhouse gas footprint of its own operations While Amazon is willing to talk about its recent renewable energy deals, the company provides few details on its sourcing of recycled materials that are going into its devices, nor does it publish any restrictions on hazardous chemicals in its devices or being used in its supply chain as other leading electronics brands provide
{\textbar}{\textbar} Planned obsolescence as design feature: Faced with market saturation for their devices in many countries, companies across the sector have increasingly changed the design of their products in a way that accelerates the replacement cycle by, making them difficult to service or upgrade, shortening the useful life of otherwise functional devices Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung are among the companies moving in the wrong direction on sustainable product design HP, Dell, and Fairphone are the notable
exceptions to this trend, producing a growing number of products that are repairable and upgradable
{\textbar}{\textbar} Lack of urgency, transparency in tackling global e-waste problem: Worldwide e-waste volumes are expected to surpass 65 million metric tons in 20172 While a number of brands now offer some voluntary take-back programs, there is little if any reporting on what is actually being collected or where it goes upon collection The end result: less than 16\% of global e-waste volumes are estimated to be recycled in the formal sector,3 despite the valuable materials contained within Often “recycled” e-waste ends up at informal recyclers and handled in ways that endanger worker health and the local environment 4
{\textbar}{\textbar} Use of secondary materials remains limited, with some recent progress: While a few IT companies have incorporated recycled plastics in their products for several years, very little progress has been made in sourcing other secondary materials into new products Fairphone incorporates recycled tungsten, and Dell has shown success in using closed-loop plastic collected from its take- back channel Apple recently committed to “closing the loop” for its materials, starting with tin and aluminum
{\textbar}{\textbar} Stalled commitments to product detox: Numerous companies, including Acer, Apple, Samsung, LG, Lenovo, Dell and HP made commitments in 2009/2010 to phase out PVC and BFRs from their products, to stem the tide of toxic e-waste Now in 2017, only Apple and Google products are free of BFR and PVC across their product lines
{\textbar}{\textbar} Lack of transparency and monitoring of workplace chemicals: To eliminate hazardous releases to the environment from manufacturing facilities and also to protect worker health and safety, all companies in the Guide have work to do to identify and eliminate hazardous chemicals used in the production of their products, improve worker health and safety due diligence, and develop safe substitutions Apple, Dell, Google, HP and Microsoft are the only companies in the Guide that publish their list of substances that must be restricted in the manufacturing of their devices (MRSL)},

	abstract = {Apple is on a journey to 2030.
In 2020, we reached carbon neutral for our corporate operations, but we always knew we could do more. So we set an even more ambitious goal — to make our products carbon neutral by 2030, across our entire supply chain and the lifetime energy use of our customers’ devices. Teams across Apple quickly got to work, and thanks to their innovations, we’ve made extraordinary progress.
In this year’s report, you’ll find the most detailed portrait yet of where we are today and where we’re headed. Here’s the big picture: Since 2015, we’ve reduced our emissions by over 45 percent. We did it while reaching more Apple users than ever before. And, in doing so, we demonstrated that the choice between a thriving business and a thriving planet is a false one.
This was also the year we called on our suppliers to accelerate their work to address their emissions. We’ve sent a clear message that the companies who manufacture our products must decarbonize their entire Apple footprint by 2030, including the use of 100 percent renewable electricity. And today, over 250 of our suppliers — accounting for over 85 percent of Apple’s direct manufacturing spend — are a part of our Supplier Clean Energy Program.
We share our progress — and our goals — because transparency and accountability are two sides of the same coin. We do the work and we show our work, because we want to be the ripple in the pond that creates a broader change.
This year, we’ve also made it easier to understand the carbon impact of your Apple devices, and the extraordinary steps we’re taking to reduce their emissions. In our Product Environment Reports, you can learn about recycled gold in your iPhone, the energy demands of your iPad, and the packaging around your Mac. We’re transforming so many aspects of the way we make our technology, and with our Product Environment Reports, you’ll see where we’ve made progress and where the hard work remains.
One thing is clear: We’re closer than ever to the day you can hold your Apple device and be confident in the knowledge that it has net-zero carbon impact. There are few companies that can make that claim — let alone ones that set our high standards and transparently show their progress along the way.
As we move closer to our goals, we’ve continued to push the pace by bringing new clean energy online to power our supply chain. And we’re investing in a growing number of renewable energy projects to balance the electricity our customers use to charge their devices.
Recycled materials are also a key focus of our innovations, and another way we’re driving down our emissions. Today, about 20 percent of the materials in our products are from recycled or renewable sources. Our goal is to one day reach 100 percent, and to end our reliance on mining altogether. Where we continue to extract materials, we maintain the highest standards in our due diligence and respect for human rights. And we’re accelerating our work with new goals to use 100 percent recycled cobalt, tin, gold, and rare earth elements in key components by 2025. The strides we’re making play a huge role in driving down our emissions even further, reducing our reliance on energy-intensive mining, smelting, and refining.
We’ll keep pursuing creative ways to reduce our footprint, and only use high-quality carbon offsets to balance emissions we can’t zero out. That’s why we launched the Restore Fund, which aims to help businesses invest in high-quality, nature-based solutions that restore the forests, wetlands, and grasslands that remove carbon from our atmosphere.
Equity remains a central focus of our investments in clean energy and green technology. We continue to grow our Impact Accelerator, which invests in the next generation of innovative, diverse entrepreneurs in fields like clean energy, recycling, and green chemistry. We’ve also expanded our Power for Impact program, which brings renewable projects to communities around the world — from neighborhoods in rural South Africa t  underresourced schools in the Philippines. We believe the best way to fight climate change is to engage communities on their front lines, and every day, we put the action to those words.
I’ve worn a few different hats over my career — including as Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and leading this work at Apple. It’s taught me that tackling climate change is possible only when we bring government, industry, and communities together. We have to meet a global challenge with global solutions — solutions that center on people.
I have so many talented, passionate colleagues who share in this mission Thanks to their tireless work, we’ve hurdled barriers that once seemed impossible to clear. We have no illusions about the challenges ahead, but whatever comes, we’ll keep marching forward.
Apple is on a journey — and we’ll share the road with as many people as we can. We hope you’ll join us.

	abstract = {RÉSUMÉ: De nos jours, de nombreux changements démographiques affectent la plupart des grandes villes du globe. Par exemple, les changements générationnels impliquent une population stagnante et vieillissante, alors que la taille des ménages diminue grandement, conséquence de nombreux bouleversements socio-économiques. Ces tendances s'accompagnent inévitablement de modifications dans les comportements de mobilité des personnes. En ce sens, il est pertinent de s'interroger sur la manière de planifier la demande en transport. Dans la province de Québec, au Canada, celle-ci se base uniquement sur les caractéristiques individuelles des personnes.  ABSTRACT: Nowadays, several demography changes are affecting most of the cities in the world. As an example, the population is getting older and the rate of growth appears to have come to a standstill. Also, household size diminishes due to several socio-economic changes. These trends inevitably go along with mobility behaviour adjustments. It is thus relevant to question the actual transport demand planification. In the Québec province, in Canada, it is uniquely based on individual characteristics and does not take into account the household characteristics.},

	abstract = {Part 1:LPI selection and SPT calibration
KPI selection: Material to issuer’s business model and sustainability profile
Sustainability Performance Target (SPT) calibration:
• Ambitious against issuer’s past performance
• Ambitous against issuer’s sectorial peer group
• Committed2 to be ambitious against Paris Climate Goals \& UN SDGs
The KPI selected is core, relevant and material to the issuer’s business model and consistent with its sustainability strategy. It is measurable, quantifiable, externally verifiable and benchmarkable. It covers a material scope of the operations and activities of UltraTech. The SPT calibrated by UltraTech is ambitious against the company’s past performance and compared to Construction Materials sector practices in terms of defining GHG emissions reduction target. UltraTech is one of 32 companies in its industry to have GHG emissions reduction targets, out of 99 companies included in the sector3. The SPT remains in a similar order of magnitude as other top tier companies. UltraTech has committed for the SPT to be in line with the Paris Agreement and a well below 2° Celsius warming scenario. UltraTech is currently still in the process of verifying the target with the Science-based Targets Initiative and hence ISS ESG could not confirm, at the time of issuance, the alignment of the specific target with the Paris Climat Goals. Should the final verified targets be more conservative than
those presently set out, the company has committed to comply with the more conservative set of targets as reflected in the offering circular and the terms \& conditions of the bond. ISS ESG finds that UltraTech thus clearly demonstrates its ambition and commitment to align with the Paris Climate Goals. The target is set in a clear timeline, is benchmarkable and supported
by a clear strategy and action plan.
Part 2: Alignment with the SLBPs
Aligned with ICMA Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles
The Issuer has defined a formal framework for its Sustainability-Linked Securities regarding the selection of KPI, calibration of Sustainability Performance Target (SPT), sustainability-linked securities characteristics, reporting and verification. The framework is in line with the Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles (SLBPs) administered by the ICMA.
Part 3: Link to issuer’s sustainability strategy
Consistent with UltraTech’s sustainability strategy
According to the ISS ESG Corporate Rating published 29.01.2021, the company currently shows a high sustainability performance against peers on key ESG issues faced by the Construction Materials sector and obtains a Decile Rank relative to its industry group of 3 (a decile rank of 1 indicates highest relative ESG performance out of 10). The issuer is rated 23rd
out of 99 companies within the Construction Materials sector as of 01.02.2021. The KPI selected by the issuer is related to climate change. Climate change has been defined as one of the key priorities of the issuer in terms of sustainability strategy and ISS ESG finds that this is a material sustainability topic for the issuer. ISS ESG finds that this issuance  ontributes to the issuer’s sustainability strategy thanks to the KPI’s clear link to one of the key sustainability priorities of the issuer and due to an ambitious SPT against company’s past performance, peer group and commits to be aligned with the Paris Climate Goals.},

Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.},

The transportation disadvantaged groups not only face the problems of social exclusion in location, but also experience greater exposure to a diversity of social and environmental threat. Under this context, identifying the transportation disadvantaged neighborhoods is of great interest for urban planners. This paper examines the transportation disadvantage in association with neighborhood sociodemographics in Shenzhen, China. A set of multidimensional indicators are initially selected to measure the transportation disadvantage (physical conditions, public transport services, education opportunity, employment opportunity, medical care opportunity, food opportunity, and commercial opportunity). Based on these indicators, principal component analysis produces four composite indicators of different types of transportation disadvantage: transportation disadvantage in physical infrastructure and public services, transportation disadvantage in food and education accessibility, transportation disadvantage in medical care accessibility, and transportation disadvantage in commercial and employment accessibility. In space, the transportation disadvantaged neighborhoods are generally located in the outskirts. Transportation disadvantage is more likely to be observed in neighborhoods that are economically, educationally, residentially and occupationally disadvantaged. These findings reveal significant inequalities in transportation opportunity.},

	abstract = {Off-street parking is commonly required by cities, which leads to an ever-expanding supply of spaces. This chapter reviews the literature to assess how off-street parking affects travel choices. The supply of parking has direct effects on travel, where the ease of parking makes driving more attractive, and conversely, limited or expensive parking reduces driving and encourages use of alternatives. Parking also has indirect effects on travel choices, where parking becomes a dominant feature of the built environment and inhibits walking, biking or transit use, in addition to increasing the cost of housing in places where alternatives to driving are abundant. Recent moves by some cities to reduce or eliminate parking requirements suggests that an era of parking reform is underway, and cities have tied parking reform to environmental, economic, and equity goals. Ultimately, parking remains a powerful tool for influencing travel choices, where more parking leads to more driving, but managing parking through prices and reducing required parking can nudge travelers toward other modes.},

	abstract = {Finding a parking space is a tedious and time-consuming task in a metropolitan city. Due to this problem, many researchers proposed an automatic parking lot occupancy detection system using a camera with a deep learning method to provide useful information in the smart city system. Since object detection for the parking lot is performed in real-time by utilizing CPU and GPUs while parking detection is working 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, therefore power saving is important to reduce the electricity cost. However, the energy-aware is not considered in most related works. In this paper, we proposed an energy-saving algorithm for parking lot availability detection using YOLO running on the TX2 machine. We experiment using small parking lot prototype and remote control cars. In the experiment, we compare our algorithm with the direct application of original YOLO for parking lot detection, the results show that it reduces power by 97 percent when there is no moving object in the parking lot area and 71 percent when there are moving objects in the parking lot area.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The increase in the number of vehicles has several negative impacts, including traffic congestion, air pollution, noise levels, and the availability of parking spaces. Drivers looking for parking spaces can cause traffic jams and air pollution. The solution offered at this time is the development of a smart parking system to overcome these problems. The smart parking system offers a parking availability information feature in a parking area to break up congestion in the parking space. Deep learning is a successful method to solve parking space classification problems. It is known that this method requires a large computational process. Th aims of this study are to modified the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks, part of deep learning to classify parking spaces. Modification of the Convolutional Neural Networks architecture is assumed to increase the work efficiency of the smart parking system in processing parking availability information. METHODS: Research is focusing on developing parking space classification techniques using camera sensors due to the rapid advancement of technology and algorithms in computer vision. The input image has 3x3 dimensions. The first convolution layer accepts the input image and converts it into 56x56 dimensions. The second convolution layer is composed in the same way as the first layer with dimensions of 25x25. The third convolution layer employs a 3 x 3 filter matrix with padding of up to 15 and converts it into 10x10 dimensions. The fourth layer is composed in the same way as the third layer, but with the addition of maximum pooling. The software used in the test is Python with a Python framework. FINDINGS: The proposed architecture is the Efficient Parking Network or EfficientParkingNet. It can be shown that this architecture is more efficient in classifying parking spaces compared to some other architectures, such as the mini-Alex Network (mAlexnet) and the Grassmannian Deep Stacking Network with Illumination Correction (GDSN-IC). EfficientParkingNet has not been able to pass the accuracy of Yolo Mobile Network (Yolo+MobileNet). Furthermore, Yolo+MobileNet has so many parameters that it cannot be used on low computing devices. Selection of EfficientParkingNet as a lightweight architecture tailored to the needs of use. EfficientParkingNet's lightweight computing architecture can increase the speed of information on parking availability to users. CONCLUSION: EfficientParkingNet is more efficient in determining the availability of parking spaces compared to mAlexnet, but still cannot match Yolo+MobileNet. Based on the number of parameters, EfficientParkingNet uses half of the number of parameters of mAlexnet and is much smaller than Yolo+MobileNet. EfficientParkingNet has an accuracy rate of 98.44\% for the National Research Council parking dataset and higher than other architectures. EfficientParkingNet is suitable for use in parking systems with low computing devices such as the Raspberry Pi because of the small number of parameters. (C) 2022 GJESM. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Equity refers to the fairness with which impacts (benefits and costs) are distributed. Transportation planning decisions can have large and diverse equity impacts. Evaluating these can be challenging because there are several types of equity and impacts to consider, and various ways to measure them. Horizontal equity assumes that people with similar needs and abilities should be treated equally; vertical equity assumes that disadvantaged groups should receive a greater share of resources. Social justice addresses structural inequities such as racism and sexism. This report provides guidance for transportation equity analysis. It describes various perspectives and impacts, and practical ways to incorporate transportation equity goals into policy and planning analysis.},

Based on available data from five metropolitan regions in Latin America (Brasilia, Ciudad de Me \& PRIME;xico, Montevideo, Santiago, and Sa \& SIM;o Paulo), this manuscript seeks to reduce the theoretical gap in the transport literature through the development of metrics of distributive justice based on existing Origin-Destination transport surveys, which is expected to identify the characteristics that seem to govern a fairer transport system, as well as to inform practitioners and policy makers about the conditions driving fairer urban environments. In addition to contributions to the evaluation of transport policies with data from developing countries, the discussions presented in this paper intend to provide insights into the major role of selecting the principles of justice and the distributed resources to evaluate the degrees of fairness in transportation systems.},

	abstract = {The importance of advancing transportation equity has become more visible as other structural inequities in our society have received increasing attention. Articulating approaches that practitioners use to address equity in their work, including experience-based strategies and research-developed equity metrics, contribute to supporting the achievement of transportation equity goals. However, a gap exists between knowing these approaches and integrating them into regular professional practice, in part because of barriers that span across different transportation-related contexts. To investigate practitioners' approaches to transportation equity, as well as barriers they encounter in trying to achieve improved equity, interviews were conducted with 59 transportation practitioners from the public, private, non-profit, and academic sectors. Findings revealed that a majority of the transportation practitioners in the study engaged in addressing equity in their work, including through collaborating with other organizations and sectors, integrating non-transportation-related data, and considering the contextual needs of vulnerable communities. They identified key barriers to their implementation of transportation equity approaches, including the lack of sufficient and quality equity-related data, challenges with accessing and collecting data, and a lack of standards and metrics for measuring equity-related outcomes. These findings can guide work that supports the explicit integration of transportation equity approaches into practitioners' practices.},
