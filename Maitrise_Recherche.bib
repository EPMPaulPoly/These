  abstract = {To estimate the impact of light-colored surfaces (roofs and pavements) and urban vegetation (trees, grass, shrubs) on meteorology and air quality of a city, it is essential to accurately characterize various urban surfaces. Of particular importance is the characterization of the area fraction of various surface-types as well as the vegetative fraction. In this paper, a method is discussed for developing data on surface-type distribution and city-fabric (land cover) makeup (percentage of various surface-types) using high-resolution orthophtos. We devised a semi-automatic Monte Carlo method to sample the data and visually identify the surface-type for each pixel. The color aerial photographs for Sacramento covered a total of about 65km2, at 0.3-m resolution. Five major land-use types were examined: (1) downtown and city center, (2) industrial, (3) offices, (4) commercial, and (5) residential. In downtown Sacramento, the top view (above-the-canopy) shows that vegetation covers 30\% of the area, whereas roofs cover 23\% and paved surfaces (roads, parking areas, and sidewalks) 41\%. In the industrial areas, vegetation covers 8--14\% of the area, whereas roofs cover 19--23\%, and paved surfaces 29--44\%. The surface-type percentages in the office area were 21\% trees, 16\% roofs, and 49\% paved areas. In commercial areas, vegetation covers 5--20\%, roofs 19--20\%, paved surfaces 44--68\%. Residential areas exhibit a wide range of percentages among their various surface-types. On average, vegetation covers about 36\% of the area, roofs about 20\%, and paved surfaces about 28\%. Trees mostly shade streets, parking lots, grass, and sidewalks. In most non-residential areas, paved surfaces cover 50--70\% of the under-the-canopy area. In residential areas, on average, paved surfaces cover about 35\% of the area. Land-use/land cover (LULC) data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) was used to extrapolate these results from neighborhood scales to metropolitan Sacramento. Of an area of roughly 800km2, defining most urban areas of the metropolitan Sacramento, about half is residential. The total roof area comprises about 150km2 and the total paved surfaces (roads, parking areas, sidewalks) are about 310km2. The total vegetated area covers about 230km2. The remaining 110km2 consist of barren land and miscellaneous surfaces.},

However, how curbside parking regulations (i.e. paid parking) affect car ownership remains unclear. Here, we employ a two-way fixed effect model using panel data and difference-in-differences estimations to determine the causal impact of changes in parking regulations and the impact of an extension of a city-wide parking policy in Barcelona. Our results show that the introduction of paid curbside parking to reduce non-resident/visitor demand had a positive impact on resident car ownership levels (who enjoy parking permits for free or at a very low cost -- 1{\texteuro}/week). Our calculation of the net social cost of reallocating curbside parking to residents indicates that the costs derived from the residents' parking subsidy and their likely increase in car usage can easily offset the benefits derived from visitor-trip deterrence, showing the relevance of the tradeoff between efficiency and acceptability.},

Our experiments show that our solution outperforms and generalizes the best performing approaches on both datasets.

The performance and the outcomes of different ML/DL algorithms may vary depending upon the data sets being used, as well as on the suitability of algorithms to the data and the application domain under consideration. Hence, determining which ML/DL algorithm is most suitable for a specific application domain and its related data sets would be a key advantage. To respond to this need, a comparative analysis of well-known ML/DL techniques, including Multilayer Perceptron, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Voting Classifier (or the Ensemble Learning Approach) for the prediction of parking space availability has been conducted. This comparison utilized Santander's parking data set, initiated while working on the H2020 WISE-IoT project. The data set was used in order to evaluate the considered algorithms and to determine the one offering the best prediction. The results of this analysis show that, regardless of the data set size, the less complex algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN outperform complex algorithms such as Multilayer Perceptron, in terms of higher prediction accuracy, while providing comparable information for the prediction of parking space availability. In addition, in this paper, we are providing Top-K parking space recommendations on the basis of distance between current position of vehicles and free parking spots.},

Aerial images provide valuable information over a large area instantaneously; nevertheless, no current dataset captures the complexity of aerial scenes at the level of granularity required by real-world applications. To address this, we introduce SkyScapes, an aerial image dataset with highly-accurate, fine-grained annotations for pixel-level semantic labeling. SkyScapes provides annotations for 31 semantic categories ranging from large structures, such as buildings, roads and vegetation, to fine details, such as 12 (sub-)categories of lane markings. We have defined two main tasks on this dataset: dense semantic segmentation and multi-class lane-marking prediction. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate state-of-the-art segmentation methods on SkyScapes. Existing methods struggle to deal with the wide range of classes, object sizes, scales, and fine details present. We therefore propose a novel multi-task model, which incorporates semantic edge detection and is better tuned for feature extraction from a wide range of scales. This model achieves notable improvements over the baselines in region outlines and level of detail on both tasks.},

Unlike traditional parking models, PARKAGENT simulates the behavior of each driver in a spatially explicit environment and is able to capture the complex self-organizing dynamics of a large collective of parking agents within a non-homogeneous (road) space. The model generates distributions of key values like search time, walking distance, and parking costs over different driver groups. It is developed as an ArcGIS application, and can work with a practically unlimited number of drivers. The advantages of the model are illustrated using a real-life case from Tel Aviv. Taking detailed data from field surveys, the model is used to study the impact of additional parking supply in a residential area with a shortage of parking places. The PARKAGENT model shows that additional parking supply linearly affects the occurrence of extreme values, but has only a weak impact on the average search time for a parking place or the average walking distance between the parking place and the destination.},

  abstract = {Inventory of road infrastructure represents a key application for integrated mobile mapping systems. The classical approach is to post-process geo-referenced imagery that has been captured from mobile mapping vans while driving within the road. Problems arise then within city centres where dense traffic and parking vehicles may often hinder occlusion free image captures of the objects of interest. We present an alternative solution in terms of a mobile PDA based geo-information system for pedestrian based road sign data collection which is targeted towards complementing the classical approach, particularly in city centres. The novel system consists of a mobile computing unit which is equipped with a GPS sensor, a digital camera, a standard mobile GIS software, and a user interface for minimal user intervention. Imagery for road sign inventory is firstly captured and geo-referenced in the street and then analyzed in a second, off-line processing step. We present a post-processing tool for semi-automated classification of road signs, and in parallel an identification of the sub-plate information, strongly supporting the processing of huge data sets, e.g., for the processing of data from complete city areas. The tool includes advanced image analysis methodology with (i) localization of selective key descriptors and regions of interest, (ii) the fitting of geometrical constraints to the extracted set of interest descriptors, and (iii) the matching of content information from the visual information within the sign plate. Text information on the sub-plate is first detected using a wavelet based texture filter, and then post-processed with segmentation operators and standard OCR software. The system has been successfully applied in a project on a complete inventory within the City of Graz, Austria, processing more than 30.000 road signs. The system achieved high accuracy ({$\approx$}90\%) in the automated image based classification of road signs on more than 20 different road sign classes. {\copyright} 2007 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

Literature review, however, indicates that there is a significant gap between its technology development and applications in urban planning because of discipline barriers. This study is, therefore, intent to address such a gap by studying the effectiveness of two image classification software (ENVI 4.5 and Definiens Professional 5) on extracting urban subzonal land covers, and investigating the usefulness/accuracy of the extracted information in urban planning process. Several satellite images, including Landsat ETM+, SPOT4, IKONOS, and QuickBird, are used in our testing. It is found that medium-resolution images, such as Landsat ETM+ and SPOT4, are only good at extracting large-size homogeneous objects, such as vegetation and water bodies, but less powerful in extracting small urban features, including buildings, streets and parking lots, due to their low spatial resolutions. Later experiments focus on extracting these small-size urban features with VHR imagery from IKONOS and QuickBird. Classification results show that both software packages have more or less problems in distinguish parking lots, streets and building roofs because of similar materials used and therefore, very close spectral signatures. It is found that the object-oriented hierarchical algorithm applied to QuickBird images offers the highest extraction accuracy for building and street classes with a producer's accuracy (PA) of 78\% and 63\% respectively, when compared to other algorithms, such as maximum likelihood and nearest neighbour, and images (QuickBird and IKONOS) combinations. Recommendations and discussions about how to improve the current results by using off-leave images and supplementary data are also presented.},

  abstract = {Parking serves as the terminal facility for automobile-oriented transportation systems, but the impacts of its provision are often left unstudied. Providing too much parking in cities can undermine long-term transportation and development goals by creating a sparse or fragmented built environment. This study examined the changes in parking supplies, development characteristics, and travel mode shares in the past 60 years in six medium-sized cities. In three of these cities, parking supply increased significantly during the study period; in the other three cities parking supply increased only slightly. The main objective of this paper is to illustrate how these changes in parking supplies have affected the tax revenues in each city. An analysis based on geographic information systems was used to calculate the tax revenue of all properties in the study area of each city. Tax revenues generated from parking were quantified and were compared with tax revenues from nonparking uses on a proportional basis. Across the six cities, land occupied by surface parking contributed between 5\% and 17\% of the tax revenue that land occupied by taxable nonparking uses contributed. The analysis characterized an important concession involved in devoting large areas of land in the center of a city to surface parking.},

The main objective of this research is to develop analysis methods to study parking supply and use. More precisely, the following specific objectives are pursued :  Design of automated tools to analyze parking sign data of the city of Montr{\'e}al, in order to study parking supply and how it varies in time and space.  Development of automated procedures to analyze parking utilization using trip data from the Origin-Destination (OD) survey.  Development of an information system integrating the supply estimations and the utilization behaviors derived from the OD survey. The first step of this project is to review past research conducted on parking. The review focuses on research made on parking utilization, as well as on parking management and on the many impacts of parking on travel behaviors, use of transportation systems and on the structure of cities.},

Pooling is used to achieve invariance to image transformations, more compact representations, and better robustness to noise and clutter. Several papers have shown that the details of the pooling operation can greatly influence the performance, but studies have so far been purely empirical. In this paper, we show that the reasons underlying the performance of various pooling methods are obscured by several confounding factors, such as the link between the sample cardinality in a spatial pool and the resolution at which low-level features have been extracted. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of max pooling and average pooling, and give extensive empirical comparisons for object recognition tasks.},

  abstract = {Shortages of street parking can cause cruising, a major source of urban congestion. We used SFpark, a federally funded experiment in market-priced parking in San Francisco, to study how changes in meter prices influenced on-street parking availability. We supervised observations of more than 13,400 vehicles parked on a subset of dynamically priced and control blocks at three points in time during 2011 and 2012. Repeated-observation, change-on-change regressions show that when prices rose, the block-level occupancy of parking fell, suggesting that SFpark worked as intended. But blocks where prices rose showed no discernible improvement in parking availability---the share of time at least one space on a block face was vacant. Price increases also had no association with other factors we would expect to be influenced by price, including parking duration, vehicle turnover, and carpooling. These relationships were robust to controlling for the parking zone, the previous price level, nearby employment, and the weather. A price system designed to improve average occupancy may not improve parking availability, and thus may not reduce cruising. Cities trying to reduce cruising may need to adjust prices based on minimum vacancy, and price changes may need to be larger in many cases.},

To handle the problem of segmenting objects at multiple scales, we design modules which employ atrous convolution in cascade or in parallel to capture multi-scale context by adopting multiple atrous rates. Furthermore, we propose to augment our previously proposed Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, which probes convolutional features at multiple scales, with image-level features encoding global context and further boost performance. We also elaborate on implementation details and share our experience on training our system. The proposed `DeepLabv3' system significantly improves over our previous DeepLab versions without DenseCRF post-processing and attains comparable performance with other state-of-art models on the PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation benchmark.},

  abstract = {The San Francisco Bay Area (herein, the Bay Area) is one of the most progressive transportation regions in the deployment of high-capacity transit and use of policies to encourage active transportation. Yet like many other metro regions, there remains a dearth of knowledge on the abundance and location of parking infrastructure supply. Parking infrastructure remains one of the least catalogued infrastructure but is perhaps the most spatially dominating set of assets. The extent and location of parking supply, including on-street and off-street spaces, are estimated for the nine-county Bay Area. This parking space inventory is the most detailed assessment of parking infrastructure produced for the Bay Area, and represents an important starting point for addressing the impacts of and crafting policy for future transportation goals. On-street and off-street spaces are estimated using different approaches. On-street spaces are estimated for largely local and collector roadways based on usable curb length removing un-parkable space associated with bus stations, intersections, bridges, tunnels, driveways, and fire hydrants. Spaces on each roadway link were assigned a residential or non-residential classification. Off-street spaces were estimated by joining a regional assessor database with municipal parking requirements. The corresponding county assessor databases were from the years 2020-2021. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission's consolidated assessor database that levels the nine Bay Area counties with common land use codes was used. Parking requirements for 96 of the 101 municipalities in the Bay Area were identified (the remaining 5 were estimated as averages for other municipalities in the region). These requirements were largely from contemporary years, but two dated back to around 1990. The joining of the assessor databases and the requirements were largely based on bedrooms (residential) and building or parcel area (non-residential) although several exceptions (edge cases) had to be addressed. These 1\% of parcels included land uses such as hospitals, schools, assembly places, universities, restaurants, stadiums, and multi-story structures. Manual counts of satellite images and supplementary data were often used to supplement or validate estimates. The results provide critical information for focusing policies and urban form changes aimed at affecting parking supply and demand towards reduced automobility.  There are an estimated 15 million spaces in the region, 8.6 million on-street and 6.4 million off-street. End-to-end, Bay Area parking would stretch around the Earth 2.3 times. There are 1.9 spaces per person, 2.7 spaces per employed individual, and 2.4 spaces per auto and light-duty truck. Residential parking dominates the share of supply at 70\% and commercial at 9.4\%. Space density (spaces per acre) is highest in downtown San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose largely attributed to high-rise structures. On-street parking is dominant in the North Bay, commanding 78\% of total parking in Napa, 75\% in Solano, 68\% in Sonoma, and 67\% in Marin County. Pockets of dense off-street parking are seen throughout the Bay Area but tend to be concentrated in the more heavily urbanized areas along the East Bay and Peninsula subregions from San Francisco and Oakland south to San Jose. There are three census blocks where the parking area exceeds land area. However, at the building scale, there are over 3,200 non-residential and 780 residential parcels where parking area exceeds land area (out of a total of 2.1 million parcels). Parking area constitutes 7.9\% of the total incorporated area. By comparison, less than 1\% of the region's incorporated area can be characterized as dense, mixed-use areas that support walking and transit.1 Certain zoning practices can drive the share of parking up significantly. Commercial neighborhoods dominated by low-rise buildings with large surface lots have parking land area shares of 21-44\% of total land area, and stadiums with extensive surface lots can command 81\% of land area for parking.  Comparing the Bay Area against Los Angeles and Phoenix provides helpful insights into the commitment, extent, and utilization of parking. The Bay Area with a population of 7.7 million people has less parking per person (1.9 spaces) than the Phoenix metro region (4.0 million people and 2.7 spaces per person) but the same as Los Angeles County (9.8 million people and 1.9 spaces per person). The Bay Area has 2.4 spaces per auto and light-duty truck, well below Phoenix metro (4.3) and Los Angeles County (3.3). It also outperforms on spaces per job at 2.7 (with Phoenix metro at 6.6 and Los Angeles County at 4.7). The portion of paved surfaces taken up by parking in the Bay Area is significantly smaller than Phoenix Metro and Los Angeles County. Approximately 20\% of the incorporated area of the Bay Area is paved with parking (7.9\%) and roadways (12.4\%). This is roughly one-half that of the 36\% paved Phoenix metro (10\% parking, 26\% roadways) and the 41\% paved Los Angeles County (14\% parking, 27\% roadways)},

  abstract = {The US parking infrastructure is vast and little is known about its scale and environmental impacts. The few parking space inventories that exist are typically regionalized and no known environmental assessment has been performed to determine the energy and emissions from providing this infrastructure. A better understanding of the scale of US parking is necessary to properly value the total costs of automobile travel. Energy and emissions from constructing and maintaining the parking infrastructure should be considered when assessing the total human health and environmental impacts of vehicle travel. We develop five parking space inventory scenarios and from these estimate the range of infrastructure provided in the US to be between 105 million and 2 billion spaces. Using these estimates, a life-cycle environmental inventory is performed to capture the energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases, CO, SO2, NOX, VOC (volatile organic compounds), and PM10 (PM: particulate matter) from raw material extraction, transport, asphalt and concrete production, and placement (including direct, indirect, and supply chain processes) of space construction and maintenance. The environmental assessment is then evaluated within the life-cycle performance of sedans, SUVs (sports utility vehicles), and pickups. Depending on the scenario and vehicle type, the inclusion of parking within the overall life-cycle inventory increases energy consumption from 3.1 to 4.8 MJ by 0.1--0.3 MJ and greenhouse gas emissions from 230 to 380 g CO2e by 6--23 g CO2e per passenger kilometer traveled. Life-cycle automobile SO2 and PM10 emissions show some of the largest increases, by as much as 24\% and 89\% from the baseline inventory. The environmental consequences of providing the parking spaces are discussed as well as the uncertainty in allocating paved area between parking and roadways.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings : Many cities have adopted minimum parking requirements, but there is relatively poor information about how parking infrastructure has grown. We estimate how parking has grown in Los Angeles County (CA) from 1900 to 2010 and how parking infrastructure evolves, affects urban form, and relates to changes in automobile travel using building and roadway growth models. We find that since 1975 the ratio of residential off-street parking spaces to automobiles in Los Angeles County is close to 1.0 and the greatest density of parking spaces is in the urban core, while most new growth in parking occurs outside of the core. In total, 14\% of Los Angeles County's incorporated land is committed to parking. Uncertainty in our space inventory is attributed to our building growth model, on-street space length, and the assumption that parking spaces were created as per the requirements. Takeaway for practice : The continued use of minimum parking requirements is likely to encourage automobile use at a time when metropolitan areas are actively seeking to manage congestion and increase transit use, biking, and walking. Widely discussed ways to reform parking policies may be less than effective if planners do not consider the remaining incentives to auto use created by the existing parking infrastructure. Planners should encourage the conversion of existing parking facilities to alternative uses.},

Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction policies have created interest in better understanding how public transit systems reduce emissions. Yet the use of average emission factors (e.g., grams CO2e per distance traveled) persists as the state-of-the-art masking the variations in emissions across time, and confounding the ability to accurately estimate the environmental effects from changes to transit infrastructure and travel behavior. An LCA is developed of the Expo light rail line and a competing car trip (in Los Angeles, California) that includes vehicle, infrastructure, and energy production processes, in addition to propulsion. When results are normalized per passenger kilometer traveled (PKT), life-cycle processes increase energy use and GHG emissions up to 83\%, and up to 690\% for smog and respiratory impact potentials. However, the use of a time-independent PKT normalization obfuscates a decision-maker's ability to understand whether the deployment of a transit system reduces emissions below a future year policy target (e.g., 80\% of 1990 emissions by 2050). The year-by-year marginal effects of the decision to deploy the Expo line are developed including reductions in automobile travel. The time-based marginal results provide clearer explanations for how environmental effects in a region change and the critical life-cycle processes that should be targeted to achieve policy targets. It shows when environmental impacts payback and how much reduction is achieved by a policy-specified future year.},

  abstract = {Few studies have investigated how parking requirements (norms) for households and home parking availability influence car ownership and car-use. The common practice of local authorities is to use minimum parking norms for housing, and, in some urban areas, also maximum parking norms. This means that local authorities in general do not aim to influence car-use or car ownership by, for example, restricting the number of parking spaces or locating them some distance away. The objective of this paper is to analyse whether there are systematic differences in car ownership and car-use that can be linked to differences in parking norms, parking facilities and location. This knowledge would be of value to both the research community and authorities. We use the dataset of the Norwegian National Travel Survey (NTS) 2013 consisting of about 60,000 interviews of individuals 13 years and older. A sample of over 2,000 urban dwellers was selected from this NTS for an additional in-depth parking survey. We asked detailed questions about home parking. The NTS 2013 and parking survey were merged and travel habits and background variables linked with detailed information about home parking availability. This provided an excellent opportunity to analyse how variations in parking facilities influence travel behaviour and car ownership. Our data show that access to private or reserved parking triples the likelihood of car ownership. Trip frequency does not change with car ownership or access to home parking, but it does affect mode share. The longer the distance between home and the actual location of home parking the more reduced the car modal share. People are on average willing to accept more than 100 m between home and home parking. Physical separation of the two would therefore facilitate more efficient housing and less car driving. Free street parking may jeopardise this, however.},

  abstract = {Car ownership and car use depend on numerous factors, among which are parking availability at destination and at home. While the former has attracted considerable research efforts for decades the latter, home parking, has recently become subject to increasing research interest. We use evidence from the 2013/14 Norwegian National Travel Survey, and combine this with additional geographical context data. In this way, we analyse the impact of parking availability at home and at destination on car use, while controlling for different urban contexts like housing and job density, and population density. The analysis is divided into three. The first part links car use to availability and payment arrangements of workplace parking. The second is concerned with the impact of home parking accessibility and car use. The third set of regressions looks at the combined effect of parking at trip start and the trip end on car use. Reduced access to free workplace parking stands out as one of the most effective ways of reducing car use on work trips. Maximum parking standards are therefore important parts of an urban planner's toolbox. Workplace parking fees can be effective when parking capacity is abundant and especially so if payment is made on a daily basis. Car use is in fact almost doubled where employees can pay monthly instead of daily. Limited access to parking at home also affects car use. The decision to drive decreases with increasing walking distance to the car park, especially in densely built-up areas. Restricted parking both at home and at the trip destination add up to very low odds of car use. Parking restrictions will have the greatest effect in compact cities.},

  abstract = {Parking supply is one of the most neglected elements of the built environment in travel behavior research, despite evidence linking parking with vehicle use. As transportation impacts of new development are increasingly measured by vehicle miles traveled (VMT), explicitly connecting parking characteristics with vehicle travel is necessary to better inform transportation and land use policy. In this paper, we begin to address this research gap and explore the relationship between constrained parking and household VMT. Utilizing the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) California add-on sample, we estimate residential parking constraint for households in Los Angeles County. Then, we develop a two-level model framework. Level 1 (Cost) models estimate travel costs, represented by vehicle ownership as a function of parking constraints, the built environment, and demographics. Level 2 (Demand) models regress household-level total and homebased-work VMT on predicted vehicle ownership, controlling for temporal and environmental characteristics. To further explore the relationship between parking and VMT by place type, we applied Level 1 and Level 2 models to develop a suite of scenarios for typical households in Los Angeles County. Our findings support the hypothesis that the built environment (including parking) influences VMT through travel costs (vehicle ownership). Results from scenarios analysis reveal constrained on-site residential parking ({$<$}\,1 parking space per dwelling unit), accounts for an approximate 10--23 percentage-point decrease in VMT within each place type. Finally, implications for practice and future research are presented.},

This insensitivity results in sometimes exaggerated estimates, an increase associated transportation impact fees, and a need for additional mitigation of impacts which may further hinder land development. In this study, we collected and analyzed person and motorized vehicle count data from 26 affordable housing developments in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Counts were regressed upon site and built environment characteristics known to influence site-level travel behavior (e.g., parking supply, employment density), and regressions were validated using externally collected data. The findings indicate the average square footage of dwelling units, parking ratios, and nearby retail employment densities to be important predictors. The findings also indicate that increasing the parking supply from one space to two for each dwelling unit will result in a significant predicted increase of approximately 0.26 and 0.18 motorized vehicle trips per dwelling unit for AM and PM peak periods, respectively. These findings reiterate the need for trip generation methodologies sensitive to the built environment and sociodemographics.},

In this paper, we: (a) explore literature linking parking policies and vehicle use (including vehicle trip generation, vehicle miles traveled [VMT], and trip length) through the lens of development-level evaluations (e.g., transportation impact analyses [TIA]); (b) develop a conceptual map linking development-level parking characteristics and vehicle use outcomes based on previously supported theory and frameworks; and (c) evaluate and discuss the conventional approach to identify the steps needed to operationalize this link, specifically for residential development. Our findings indicate a significant and noteworthy dearth of studies incorporating parking constraints into travel behavior studies---including, but not limited to: parking supply, costs or pricing, and travel demand management strategies such as the impacts of (un)bundled parking in housing costs. Disregarding parking in TIAs ignores a significant indicator in automobile use. Further, unconstrained parking may encourage increases in car ownership, vehicle trips, and VMT in areas with robust alternative-mode networks and accessibility, thus creating greater demand for vehicle travel than would otherwise occur.

  abstract = {Urban sprawl is considered by most environmental scientists and urban planners to be a serious environmental problem. However, public perception about parking availability often forces planning offices to recommend parking lot sizes that exceed daily demands. The recent trend of increasing the size of stores, churches and even schools comes with increasing the size of parking lots that service these buildings. The objective of this paper is to analyze space allocation of parking lots in a typical midwestern county and to estimate the supply of parking spaces to potential demand. We also estimate the loss of ecosystem services represented by the area of parking lots in this county. We found that parking lots cover 5.65km2 (1 397acres) of Tippecanoe County, Indiana which implies that 0.44\% of the county area is devoted to parking lots. Our results show that there are approximately 2.2 parking spaces per registered vehicle, that parking lots make up more than 6.57\% of the total urban footprint in this county, that the area of parking lots exceeded the area of parks in the city limits by a factor of three and that parking lot runoff and pollutants are significant compared to runoff and pollutants from these areas prior to their conversion to parking lots. As other authors have done before us we lament the poor use of land in urban regions of the United States, and encourage planners to think creatively about the use of land for parking.},

Parking lots are virtually everywhere in urban and suburban environments, are often larger than the building footprints they serve yet they are largely unregulated on a regional scale. We focus on a method that estimates parking lot coverage over the four state region and use independent studies to estimate model parameters and validate our model. In total, we estimate that the states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin allocate 1260km2 of their land to parking lots, with the lower bound of the estimate at 976km2 and the upper bound at 1745km2. This accounts for approximately 4.97\% of urban land use and over 43 million parking spaces whereas the number of adults over 18 years old in these four states amounted to just over 25 million. The estimated number of spaces per vehicle in each state ranges from 2.49 in Indiana to 2.95 in Michigan. Within the four states studied, states that had a higher proportion of their urban land devoted to parking lots were states where urban sprawl was more prevalent.},

However, a common problem that researchers in this field very often face is the lack of a representative dataset to perform their experiments. To mitigate this difficulty, in this paper we introduce a new parking lot dataset composed of 695,899 images captured from two parking lots with three different camera views. The acquisition protocol allows obtaining static images showing illumination variance related to sunny, overcast and rainy days. We believe that researchers will find this dataset a very useful tool since it allows future benchmarking and evaluation. The dataset is currently available for research purposes upon request. To gain a better insight into this dataset we have evaluated two textural descriptors, Local Binary Patterns and Local Phase Quantization, with a Support Vector Machine classifier to detect parking lot vacancy. In the experiments where the same view was used for both training and testing, we have reached outstanding recognition rates, greater than 99\%. The main challenge, though, lies in building a general classifier that is able to detect parking spaces from the parking lots that were not used for training. In this sense, the best result achieved by the texture-based classifier was about 89\%. The observed drop in terms of performance shows that additional investigation is necessary to create classification schemes less dependent on the training set. Other researchers can use these results as a baseline performance when testing their own algorithms on this dataset.},

  abstract = {In planning new apartment developments, off-street car parking provision is frequently raised as a key concern. However, there is little understanding of the adequacy of off-street car parking for individual apartment households. Drawing on a survey of apartment residents in Perth, Melbourne, and Sydney (n~=~1316), this research assesses the adequacy of off-street car parking provision for apartment households and provides an understanding of factors associated with an undersupply and oversupply of off-street car parking. Results show that around two-thirds (65.9\%) of apartment households have a `balanced' amount of off-street car parking, where the number of cars owned is equal to the number of allocated off-street car parking spaces. The remaining households either have an oversupply of off-street car parking (20.2\%) or an undersupply (14.0\%), almost always involving one parking space too many or one too few. Factors associated with an under/oversupply of off-street car parking are found to be largely related to household characteristics and residents' perceptions of parking issues. The findings highlight the potential for `unbundling' off-street car parking from the purchase price or rental cost of apartment housing, while developing more tailored residential parking requirements that seek to prevent an under/oversupply of parking.},

Using a case study of Melbourne, the demand for car parking at residential apartment buildings in proximity to high frequency public transport is assessed, while controlling for a range of socio-demographic, urban design and demand management variables. Key findings indicate that while lower demand for car parking is associated with proximity to high quality public transport, this association is not significant when controlling for other factors that influence car ownership. Public transport service supply within 800~m of residential apartment buildings was instead found to be significant, rather than simple distance to transit. Modelling results suggest an inelastic relationship whereby a 10\% increase in public transport service supply is associated with a 0.9--1.2\% reduction in car parking demand as measured by levels of car ownership. Notwithstanding broader criticisms of residential off-street parking minimums, the findings have important implications for the development of residential car parking policies, suggesting that city-wide car parking requirements should appropriately reflect the spatial distribution and quality of public transport services.},

It also reviews the state-of-the-practice on demarcating on-street parking spaces and the results of a survey of local jurisdictions' policies and practice and the logic behind the decision-making process.

Parking management, which makes the link between land use and transportation, is one of the crucial ways to meet these challenges. In the Greater Montreal Area, data from origin-destination (OD) surveys is helpful in understanding typical travel behaviour. This study processes car driver trips from travel surveys to develop vehicle accumulation profiles and derive theoretical parking supplies from the observed parking demand, defined as the maximal number of cars parked in an area at a given time. This research also provides an assessment of the quality of the estimation by comparing the parking supplies derived from an OD survey to parking supplies estimated from public geographical information systems and field surveys. The paper shows that parking supply is subject to high variability and highlights that its assessment must take into account regulation data (obtained from on-street regulation parking signs data) that modulates the availability of the raw parking supply according to different days and hours of the day.},

  abstract = {To promote land-efficient development that supports nonautomobile modes of transportation, many municipalities are trying to implement parking policies that minimize parking oversupply and use existing parking supply more effectively. A commonly proposed strategy is for municipalities to lower their minimum parking standards. However, parking supply decisions are based on many factors, and experience shows that reducing parking standards does not always lead to corresponding reductions in parking supply. Using the results of an extensive commercial parking survey conducted across the City of Toronto, Canada, this study develops an empirical approach to determine whether reductions in parking standards are likely to lead to reductions in the amount of parking supplied by new development. It is proposed that the proportion of existing sites supplying less parking than existing standards require can be used as an indicator of the likelihood of developers to respond to reductions in parking standards by providing less parking. This assumes that the development characteristics of surveyed sites can be considered representative of current development practices. Applying such an analysis to Toronto, it is expected that reducing the parking standards for general office, medical office, and general retail uses will be a successful strategy in encouraging new development to provide fewer parking spaces on average. Such a strategy will be less successful for bank and large grocery uses, which tend to provide more parking and are less sensitive to minimum parking standards.},

In this work two suburbs of Vitoria City, in Brazil, were considered. The economic value of the urban space varies according to the demand and supply law, and it depends on the preference and needs of the population. Literature states that when transport infrastructure takes a significant plot of land, the boundaries of the occupied area tend to expand, and new areas are impacted by the settlements. As a consequence, more investments are necessary to provide urban services to attend population demands. By digital photo-interpretation of images, areas occupied by streets, avenues, and car parking areas were identified, quantified and compared with the whole area of the suburbs. Traffic volumes in the main streets of both suburbs were also compared with the area occupied by the road network. The results showed different infrastructure patterns and occupation, and the indication of unsustainable use of the urban space as concerns transportation.

The network is self-organized by "learning without a teacher", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname "neocognitron". After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells', which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any "teacher" during the process of selforganization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cells of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

  abstract = {Parking regulations are a central part of American zoning. There is mounting evidence about the negative effects of parking requirements on the environment and housing affordability. Given this evidence, some cities have reduced or eliminated parking requirements in certain areas. Our research examines how real estate developers respond to municipal parking reforms. We answer two questions. First, how do parking requirements affect the amount of parking provided in new residential developments? Second, how do developers' responses vary by building and neighborhood characteristics? This research analyzes Seattle, Washington (USA), the site of 2012 policy reforms that reduced or eliminated parking requirements in most central and transit-oriented neighborhoods. Our dataset consists of 868 developments with 60,361 housing units approved between 2012 and 2017. We use descriptive statistics, build a counterfactual scenario, and specify ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models to identify relationships between parking requirements and actual parking provision. We find that parking provision is closely, though not completely, tied to parking requirements. More than one-third of developments in the sample included the exact amount of required parking, including about two-thirds of developments subject to a minimum of one parking space per housing unit. About 70\% of developments with no parking requirements did include some parking. Parking requirements were the most important predictor of the actual quantity of parking provision in the regression results using the full sample. There was more parking provision in less dense and mixed-use developments, and in neighborhoods with higher employment densities. Seattle developers built 40\% less parking than would have been required prior to the reforms, resulting in 18,000 fewer parking spaces and saving an estimated \$537 million.},

Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly utilized for this purpose, their effectiveness is constrained by limitations in capturing long-range relationships and contextual details due to the localized nature of convolution operations. This study introduces the masked-attention mask transformer (Mask2Former), based on the Swin Transformer, for building footprint extraction from large-scale satellite imagery. To enhance the capture of large-scale semantic information and extract multiscale features, a hierarchical vision transformer with shifted windows (Swin Transformer) serves as the backbone network. An extensive analysis compares the efficiency and generalizability of Mask2Former with four CNN models (PSPNet, DeepLabV3+, UpperNet-ConvNext, and SegNeXt) and two transformer-based models (UpperNet-Swin and SegFormer) featuring different complexities. Results reveal superior performance of transformer-based models over CNN-based counterparts, showcasing exceptional generalization across diverse testing areas with varying building structures, heights, and sizes. Specifically, Mask2Former with the Swin transformer backbone achieves a mean intersection over union between 88\% and 93\%, along with a mean F-score (mF-score) ranging from 91\% to 96.35\% across various urban landscapes.},

The paper analyzes 770 households randomly selected from a household travel survey in the New York City region, and measures their complete parking supply, including garage size, driveway spaces, and on-street parking availability, using Google Streetviews and Bing Maps. Results from a nested logit model show that parking supply can significantly determine household car ownership decisions, even after controlling for the endogeneity between the two. Their influence actually outperforms household income and demographic characteristics, the often-assumed dominant determinants of car ownership. Different parking types also behave differently: driveway spaces are more important to car ownership than garages probably because many residents in the study region do not use a garage for car storage. On-street parking is also important to households with off-street parking. Implications for residential parking policies like the maximum off-street parking standard, resident parking permit, and street cleaning are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Local governments' minimum street-width standards may force developers to oversupply, and residents to pay excessively for, on-street parking in residential neighborhoods. Such oversupply is often presumed to both encourage car ownership and reduce housing affordability, although little useful evidence exists either way. This article examines the impact of street-parking supply on the car ownership of households with off-street parking in the New York City area. The off- and on-street parking supply for each household was measured through Google Street View and Bing Maps. The impact of on-street parking on car ownership levels was then estimated in an innovative multivariate model. The unique set-up of the case study ensures 1) the weak endogeneity between parking supply and car ownership and 2) the low correlation between off-street and on-street parking supply, two major methodological challenges of the study. Results show that free residential street parking increases private car ownership by nearly 9\%; that is, the availability of free street parking explains 1 out of 11 cars owned by households with off-street parking. Takeaway for practice: These results offer support for community street standards that make on-street parking supply optional. They also suggest the merits of leaving the decisions of whether, and how many, on-street parking spaces to provide in new residential developments to private markets rather than regulations. Research support: This project was supported by grants from the University Transportation Research Center (Region 2) and the Wagner School Faculty Research Fund.},

Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance.

Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without bells and whistles, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners.

However, data quality is often low: managed parking places may only be partially inventoried, or parking at the curbside and on private ground may be missing. This paper presents a processing chain in which remote sensing data and statistical methods are combined to provide parking area estimates. First, parking spaces and other traffic areas are detected from aerial imagery using a convolutional neural network. Individual image segmentations are fused to increase completeness. Next, a Gamma hurdle model is estimated using the detected parking areas and OpenStreetMap and land use data to predict the parking area adjacent to streets. A systematic relationship is found between the road length and type and the parking area obtained. It is suggested that these results are informative to those needing information on parking in structurally similar regions. {\copyright} 2022 The Authors.

However, there are no standardized, complete and up-to-date databases for many urban areas. Moreover, manual data collection is expensive and time-consuming. Aerial imagery of entire cities can be used to inventory not only publicly accessible and dedicated parking lots, but also roadside parking areas and those on private property. For a realistic estimation of the total parking space, the observed use of multi-functional traffic areas is taken into account by segmenting not only parking areas but also roads according to their purpose. In this paper, different U-Net based architectures are tested for detecting all these types of visible traffic areas. A new large-scale, high-quality dataset of manual annotations is used in combination with selected contextual information from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to depict the actual use as parking space. Our models achieve a good performance on parking area segmentation, and we show the significant impact of OSM data fusion in deep neural networks on the simultaneous extraction of multiple traffic areas compared to using aerial imagery alone. {\copyright} 2021 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.

Urban parking requirements are very precise and routinely enforced despite the fact that most cities have little to no knowledge about their own parking supply. To further explore these issues, a parking inventory for metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, USA is developed by cross-referencing geospatial cadastral and roadway data with minimum parking requirements. Metropolitan Phoenix is chosen because it is relatively young, rapidly growing, highly sprawled, and car dependent. Historical growth of parking is also estimated by linking year of property development to required off-street and nearby on-street parking spaces. As of 2017, we estimate that there were 12.2 million parking spaces in the metropolitan region with 4.04 million inhabitants, 2.86 million registered personal vehicles, and 1.84 million jobs. Growth of parking in metro Phoenix has also been significant; since 1960, 10.9 million spaces have been added to the region compared to a population growth of 3.41 million, vehicle fleet growth of 2.63 million, and employment growth of 1.56 million jobs. Since the 2008 recession, parking growth in metro Phoenix has significantly slowed, but continued urban growth combined with substantial minimum parking requirements may promote more parking infrastructure than is needed. Planners and policy makers should value quantifying the growth and supply of parking in urban areas and consider reforming parking standards to promote sustainable urban growth.},

  abstract = {Parking requirements are an important part of urban planning. Parking influences a number of behaviours and measures relevant to planning, including mode choice, density, urban form and housing affordability. Much research on parking has taken place in American cities which have different demographic, regulatory, and transportation contexts than Canadian ones. This research is an examination of off-street parking requirements in Canadian cities. It focuses on parking standards for multi-unit residential buildings, explores different approaches used in this regulatory practice and sheds light on the ways in which Canadian cities are dealing with parking requirements today. This is done through a scan of parking requirements across the 30 largest cities in the country, the detailed analysis of parking policies and of their objectives in four cities, and interviews with professionals in Toronto and Vancouver on the political, economic and institutional forces that have shaped their city's parking regulations. Findings suggest that large Canadian cities are facing pressure to better manage their parking systems, leading to the development of new tools to regulate parking in increasingly sophisticated ways. The paper concludes with recommendations for planners to consider when developing parking requirements, cautions them about the ways in which such requirements can be misused, and encourages them to continue to innovate and challenge accepted practices of parking regulation.},

  abstract = {In this work we consider the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pixel-wise labeling (a.k.a., semantic segmentation) of remote sensing imagery (e.g., aerial color or hyperspectral imagery). Remote sensing imagery is usually stored in the form of very large images, referred to as "tiles", which are too large to be segmented directly using most CNNs and their associated hardware. As a result, during label inference, smaller sub-images, called "patches", are processed individually and then "stitched" (concatenated) back together to create a tile-sized label map. This approach suffers from computational ineffiency and can result in discontinuities at output boundaries. We propose a simple alternative approach in which the input size of the CNN is dramatically increased only during label inference. This does not avoid stitching altogether, but substantially mitigates its limitations. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against a vonventional stitching approach using two popular segmentation CNN models and two large-scale remote sensing imagery datasets. The results suggest that the proposed approach substantially reduces label inference time, while also yielding modest overall label accuracy increases. This approach contributed to our wining entry (overall performance) in the INRIA building labeling competition.},

However, these regions are often occluded, subject to ground bumpiness or steep slopes, and thus they are hard to segment. Firstly, the paper proposes a pyramidal solution that takes advantage of satellite views of the same scene, based on a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Training a CNN from the surveillance camera perspective is rather impossible due to the combinatory explosion generated by multiple point-of-views. However, CNNs showed great promise on previous works over satellite images. Secondly, even though there are many datasets for occupancy detection in parking lots, none of them were designed to tackle the parking block segmentation problem directly. Given the lack of a suitable dataset, we also propose APKLOT, a dataset of roughly 7000 polygons for segmenting parking blocks from the satellite perspective and from the camera perspective. Moreover, our method achieves more than 50\% intersection over union (IoU) in all the testing sets, that is, at both the satellite view and the camera view.},

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

  abstract = {When the automobile was first introduced, few Americans predicted its fundamental impact, not only on how people would travel, but on the American landscape itself. Instead of reducing the amount of wheeled transport on public roads, the advent of mass-produced cars caused congestion, at the curb and in the right-of-way, from small midwestern farm towns to New York, Chicago, Detroit, and Los Angeles. Lots of Parking examines a neglected aspect of this rise of the automobile: the impact on America not of cars in motion but of cars at rest. While most studies have tended to focus on highway construction and engineering improvements to accommodate increasing flow and the desire for speed, John A. Jakle and Keith A. Sculle examine a fundamental feature of the urban, and suburban, scene--the parking lot. Their lively and exhaustive exploration traces the history of parking from the curbside to the rise of public and commercial parking lots and garages and the concomitant demolition of the old pedestrian-oriented urban infrastructure. In an accessible style enhanced by a range of interesting and unusual illustrations, Jakle and Sculle discuss the role of parking in downtown revitalization efforts and, by contrast, its role in the promotion of outlying suburban shopping districts and its incorporation into our neighborhoods and residences. Like Jakle and Sculle's earlier works on car culture, Lots of Parking will delight and fascinate professional planners, landscape designers, geographers, environmental historians, and interested citizens alike.

  abstract = {This dissertation examines the impact of parking policies and social influence on commute mode choice using discrete choice analysis. A key feature of the dissertation is overcoming the problem of insufficient data by using unique datasets, building unique datasets, or exploring appropriate estimation strategies and assumptions. Chapter 1 studies the impact of parking prices on the decision to drive to work using the California Household Travel Survey. The chapter tackles estimation challenges posed by insufficient parking information. The first challenge is the estimation of parking prices for those who do not drive, which is addressed by using a sample selection model. The second challenge is to understand the effect of the extent of the prevalence of Employer-Paid parking coupled with incentive programs offered in-lieu of parking. To address this challenge, two extreme scenarios are examined, and a range for the marginal effects of parking prices is estimated; one scenario assumes everyone receives Employer-Paid parking coupled with in- lieu of parking incentives, and the second assumes that no one is offered such incentives. The results suggest that higher parking prices reduce driving, regardless of the followed approach. It is estimated that a 10\% increase in parking prices leads to a 1 - 2 percentage point decline in the probability of driving to work. Moreover, there seems to be no evidence of xi sample selection bias. The evidence suggests that parking pricing can indeed be an effective transportation demand management tool. Chapter 2 extends the analysis of Chapter 1 to simultaneously estimate the impact of parking pricing, parking availability, and urban form on commute mode choice. The joint role of these three factors is examined using a dataset that is constructed by merging three major different data sources. The California Household Travel Survey data are matched to two unique datasets on parking for Los Angeles County; one for prices and the other availability. Chapter 2 first examines how these three factors affect the binary decision of whether to drive, while controlling for a rich set of covariates. The analysis then becomes more specific and examines how these factors affect particular commute modes in a multinomial context. The results indicate that parking prices have a significant negative impact on the decision to drive to work, where a 10\% increase in parking prices is associated with a 1.1\% drop in the probability of driving to work. Both on-street and off-street parking availability at home, as well as urban form measures of the workplace tract, are found to significantly affect commute mode choices. These findings have important policy implications in terms of minimum parking requirements, maximum parking standards, employer-paid parking, and parking pricing policies. Chapter 3, on the other hand, examines the impact of a number of fundamental determinants of commute mode choice on transit use, and introduces the role of social influence. The determinants explored cover socioeconomic characteristics, built environment and neighborhood characteristics, transit accessibility, and trip characteristics. Social interactions have been found to affect many of the decisions of economic agents, and are likely to play a role in the decision to use transit. A unique dataset is built to conduct this analysis across a number of major US cities and examine the effects in both the residence and workplace neighborhoods, where a neighborhood is defined as a census tract. Social influence is explored along three different dimensions: space (neighborhood), income, and race. A novel instrumental variable is constructed in order to identify spatial social influence, and an alternative identification strategy is devised to identify income-group and racial social influence. The evidence sug- gests that spatial social influence exists among both coworkers and residential neighbors, and that peer effects among coworkers are larger than those among residential neighbors. Moreover, income-group social influence, among both coworkers and residential neighbors, plays a significant role in the rich commuter's decision to use transit. However, racial social influence does not affect a commuter's decision to use transit, regardless of r},

  abstract = {Together, globalisation and urbanisation are accelerating the densification of cities while disruptive technologies such as micro-mobility and ride-hailing are transforming urban mobility. Amidst this change, urban planning officials and practitioners typically remain constrained to the same urban footprint, left to grapple with earlier car-oriented development, and yet must accommodate a growing population and variety of travel modes operating within the same space. Further, they must operate alongside government officials whose re-election could depend upon appeasing suburban residents that are unable or unwilling to relocate along active transport corridors, near public transit nodes, or forgo the flexibility and comfort of private automobiles. As a result, private automobiles can become necessary for traversing urban forms already enlarged by parking, driveways, roads, highways, and flyovers. Likewise, alternatives such as public and active transport can become impractical and dangerous within urban forms that are fragmented by congestion or fast traffic. Given that urban mobility research typically focuses on keeping our pre-existing modal choices moving rather than the side-effects, daily commutes have remained unchanged for decades, and planners are better equipped to continually accommodate rather than influence our modal choices. This volume of Progress in Planning aims to strengthen the evidence base for influencing modal choice by developing a comparative framework of urban mobility, and by examining how parking policy has influenced modal choice within the three largest Australian cities: Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne. In addition, it provides reproducible methods for estimating parking supply using land use audits, parking demand using a population census, and geo-statistical modelling for determining whether and where parking policy can explain more sustainable modal choices. As such, this volume sets a research agenda for metropolitan-scale examination and coordination of transport and land use planning for sustainable rather than temporary urban mobility.},

ABSTRACT: More and more planning documents, in Qu{\'e}bec and elsewhere, aim to reallocate street space between the various users of the street, namely pedestrians, cyclists, public transit riders and motorists. Several approaches also aim to restore a balance between the different dimensions of the street: the street as a link, i.e., a space dedicated to mobility, but also the street as a place, i.e., an activity space, as well as the street as a space dedicated to environmental functions. The allocation of street space is the product of a political, administrative and technical arbitration between the various modes and uses of the street, an arbitration underpinned by implicit or explicit principles of justice. In addition, the allocation of urban space is not fixed: it varies according to the time of day, the day of the week and the time of year. However, few evaluation methods and monitoring indicators have been proposed to oversee the realization of public goals in terms of street space reallocation. Even though authorities invest colossal sums in the redevelopment of urban streets, there are still no generalizable measures to study the equitable nature of these reallocation operations and to ensure their fairness or to monitor their evolution over time. A few methods have been proposed, but they depend on surveys carried out in the field or on a manual classification of surfaces using satellite photos. At the present time, there is no systematic method for carrying out the diagnosis of the sharing of street space at a city scale. The equity of street space allocation therefore remains a difficult concept to define, measure and evaluate over time.},

  abstract = {Minimum parking standards, which require developers to build a certain amount of off-street parking spaces, are increasingly criticized for leading to excess parking supply and automobile travel in recent years. However, due to the difficulty in identifying the policy effect, few empirical studies have directly and accurately estimated the effects of parking standards on parking supply. The present study examines a parking reform in London, UK, where minimum parking standards for residential developments were replaced with maximum standards in the early 2000s. Using planning application records, we match neighboring pre-reform and post-reform developments to estimate the effect of the parking standard switch and further identify the "binding" and "capping" effects of minimum and maximum parking standards. It is found that the parking reform in London has led to a reduction of approximately 0.76 parking spaces per unit in residential development applications, or 49\% of the pre-reform level. Minimum parking standards seem to have a larger impact than maximum ones on parking supply that fell more upon inner city developments, while maximum parking standards have more influenced suburban neighborhoods. Market forces have played a major role in the decline of parking supply. The findings provide strong evidence for the market distortion effect of minimum parking standards. {\copyright} 2014.},

This technique has numerous real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, image editing, robot sensing, and medical analysis. Over the past decade, deep learning-based methods have made remarkable strides in this area. Recently, transformers, a type of neural network based on self-attention originally designed for natural language processing, have considerably surpassed previous convolutional or recurrent approaches in various vision processing tasks. Specifically, vision transformers offer robust, unified, and even simpler solutions for various segmentation tasks. This survey provides a thorough overview of transformer-based visual segmentation, summarizing recent advancements. We first review the background, encompassing problem definitions, datasets, and prior convolutional methods. Next, we summarize a meta-architecture that unifies all recent transformer-based approaches. Based on this meta-architecture, we examine various method designs, including modifications to the meta-architecture and associated applications. We also present several closely related settings, including 3D point cloud segmentation, foundation model tuning, domain-aware segmentation, efficient segmentation, and medical segmentation. Additionally, we compile and re-evaluate the reviewed methods on several well-established datasets. Finally, we identify open challenges in this field and propose directions for future research.

There is now less focus on providing sufficient parking to meet demand and more on ensuring that the issue of parking does not undermine the creation of vibrant places. The goal for the presented project is to understand parking and parking provision better as it relates to smaller cities and towns with mixed-use centers. Specifically addressed are how a dense, walk-able, mixed-use center affects parking supply and demand and how mixed-use centers compare with centers designed along more conventional lines. These questions were addressed by conducting case study assessments of six sites in New England. In general, the three mixed-use study sites provided much less parking per square foot than the conventional control sites. The study sites thrived by making much more efficient use of land for parking. The study sites also furnished a significant amount of on-street parking and relied more on shared municipal parking lots and parking garages. Given these differences, it is surprising to note that the towns with mixed-use centers demanded almost as much parking for new construction as did the towns in which the conventional sites are located. On average, the amount of parking mandated by base regulation in these six towns is about two and a half times greater than the peak use.},

However, automobile infrastructure can consume significant amounts of land that could otherwise be used for non-transportation activities.

This can result in a loss of activities from the city. This study compiles data from 12 cities in the United States to test these theoretical relationships. The findings suggest that on average each increase of 10 percentage points in the portion of commuters traveling by automobile is associated with an increase of more than 2500\,m2 of parking per 1000 people and a decrease of 1700 people/km2. In quantifying these relationships, this work provides a basis for assessing the potential impacts of transportation policy decisions on land use and on the concentration of people in cities.

However, parking is costly to provide and encourages automobile use, according to many site-specific studies. At the city scale, higher automobile use is linked to traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and negative health and safety impacts, but there is a lack of compelling, consolidated evidence that large-scale parking increases cause automobile use to rise. In this study, the Bradford Hill criteria, adopted from the field of epidemiology, were applied to determine whether increases in parking should be considered a likely cause of citywide increases in automobile use. Prior research and original data from nine U.S. cities dating to 1960 were relied on. It was found that an increase in parking provision from 0.1 to 0.5 parking space per person was associated with an increase in automobile mode share of roughly 30 percentage points. It was also demonstrated that a majority of the Bradford Hill criteria could be satisfied by using the available data; this finding offers compelling evidence that parking provision is a cause of citywide automobile use. Given the costs associated with parking and its apparent effects on automobile use, these findings warrant policies to restrict and reduce parking capacity in cities.},

  abstract = {Over the past 40 to 50 years, most American cities have experienced significant increases in automobile use. Now, to offset increasing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, many are contemplating measures to reduce automobile use. This study examined Hartford, Connecticut, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, which exhibited an increase and a decrease in automobile use, respectively, between 1960 and 2007. It is hoped that these cities provide lessons in how to successfully reduce automobile travel. The study focused on the cumulative effects of historical policy decisions over decades on parking provisions and changes in travel behavior. The results of this analysis suggest that parking policy affects incremental changes in parking provision that may greatly influence gradual changes in automobile use over time.},

Little work has been done to understand how aggregate parking supplies compare with requirements in urban areas or to evaluate the potential impacts of parking requirements met in such places. The research reported here tracked changes in parking supplies and the built environment in six urban business districts between 1960 and 2000. The work also summarized parking requirements in each city and compared those requirements with actual supplies. This research demonstrated that parking requirements could be met only through a combination of costly parking infrastructure and considerable commitments of land. In half of the cities studied (i.e., those with the more stringent parking requirements) off-street parking supply ratios increased by 150\% to 300\%; the increase required comparable amounts of land but still fell short of areawide parking requirements. Through quantification of existing parking supplies in urban areas and evaluation of the potential impacts of increases in those supplies, this work offers guidance and justification for the establishment of parking standards that conform to long-term transportation and development goals.},

  abstract = {This study documents the costs of providing infrastructure and services to different residential densities. It is an accessible, informational resource to inform municipal planning initiatives and regional growth policies pertaining to different densities and forms of residential development, such as `infill' and `greenfield'. This study summarizes available references, case studies, best practices, and informational interviews, and is focused on findings and implications most relevant to the Metro Vancouver region. It is based on a literature review of available publications and informational interviews with leading practitioners and academics. KEY CONSIDERATIONS The following should be considered when making land use and urban form decisions, as well as those associated with public infrastructure investments to support desired forms of residential land uses and densities, and when reviewing property tax and utility fee policies: - It is critical to permit and facilitate higher density and more cost-effective forms of development in urban / developed areas (i.e., infill, intensification, redevelopment), where public infrastructure investments can be best utilized. Where regulatory barriers exist to urban densification in such locations, consider a review of policies and regulations and discourage developments that are not compact form, mixed-use, and that cannot be cost-efficiently serviced. - Achieving compact, complete communities does not necessarily require extremely high density development forms. Optimum densities are a factor of context, and are often a combination of densities and uses that result in more livable, sustainable, and balanced communities. For example, moving from low density to medium densities in urban centres and along transit corridors can provide significant improvements in infrastructure servicing cost outcomes. - The costs of infrastructure and utility provision should be set to better reflect actual service costs and charge those who directly benefit:    - The use of metering for utilities should be considered, where possible, such as for water and sewerage; with new and emerging technologies, such as improved metering, user fees can be more precise and effective, and managed electronically.      - Utility fees should not be focused simply on raising revenues, but also on changing behaviours and outcomes. Fees and incentives can be set and adjusted to encourage desired actions and choices and meet community buildings objectives. -Applying Development Cost Charges that vary by residential unit type / size / density as well as subarea geography, better reflects the actual costs of servicing demand. -Closely coordinating and integrating land use planning, engineered infrastructure, asset management, and municipal financial decision-making including full lifecycle costing, leads to improved land use and financial outcomes SUMMARY FINDINGS OF THE STUDY Literature Review  `Urban sprawl' refers to dispersed, segregated (single-use), automobile-oriented, urban-fringe development, while `Smart Growth' comprises more compact, mixed-use, multi-modal forms of development. Some, but not all, public services are sensitive to a city's development patterns and residential densities.  More compact development forms tend to reduce infrastructure costs on a per capita basis, support more efficient use of resources, and encourage more sustainable forms of transportation. However, the relationships between residential densities and public costs are complex; actual costs depend on the specific services and conditions, and local context.  Higher density development forms are associated with lower per capita municipal expenditures for streets and highways, sewer, water, and solid waste.  While property taxes are for general municipal services and are calculated on assessed property values, a user fee, such as for utilities, is a charge for consuming a municipally provided good or service.  User fees are a `cost-recovery revenue tool' and must be set based on the costs of providing the good or service to the user. Case Studies -The case studies generally indicate that the infrastructure servicing costs per dwelling unit declines as residential densities increase. -This is largely associated with reduced linear infrastructure (i.e., roads, water pipes, sewer lines) per capita for higher density, compact design and development forms, as compared to lower density forms. -However, large urban infill projects still require significant infrastructure investments. Other costs, such as labour-intensive services (rather than capital-intensive infrastructure), are more directly related to population levels and incurred on a per capita basis. -Thus, the relationship between residential density and municipal costs is nuanced, and also can be impacted by local matters, such as the condition (age, capacity) of infrastructure and other physical elements such as geography and topography. Infrastructure Servicing Costs - The costs for onsite infrastructure / servicing for house vs. apartment developments are approximately five to nine times more expensive on a per capita basis (\$13,000 vs. \$2,000) and on a per unit basis (\$40,000 vs. \$5,000), respectively. -This illustrates the greater cost effectiveness of higher density and multi-unit residential development forms can be as compared to lower density, single-detached development, because the infrastructure costs can be apportioned to more units. -As most of these infrastructure costs are initially borne by a developer and ultimately the resident, lower infrastructure costs can help contribute to lower housing costs. Furthermore, after construction and development, the cost of maintaining the infrastructure is typically the responsibility of the municipality and ultimately taxpayers, therefore more efficient infrastructure systems can reduce public operating costs and fees / taxes over the long term. Development Cost Charges -Development Cost Charges (DCCs) in British Columbia are enabled under provincial legislation to pay for new or expanded infrastructure (sewer, water, drainage, parks, and roads) necessary to adequately service the demands of new development. - In Metro Vancouver, the municipal DCC rates per unit are almost always highest for single-detached houses (up to \$40,000 to \$60,000), lowest for apartment units (approximately \$10,000), and in between for townhouses. - However, when adjusted for the typical number of residents in a household, which varies by unit type, the range of per capita DCC rates vary only by a few thousand dollars, averaging: \$9,000 per apartment resident, \$10,000 per townhouse resident, and \$11,000 per house resident. - The DCC rates by unit type can vary considerably by municipality, yet within individual municipalities generally do not vary. While allowable under provincial legislation, most municipalities do not charge different DCC rates for different sub-areas or catchment areas. Municipal Expenditures Analysis -Based on a review of current municipal budgets in the region, approximately one-third of expenditures (i.e., both capital and operating costs) are related to utilities / engineering services that could be impacted to some degree by land uses, development forms, and densities, and associated infrastructure requirements with the balance (approximately two-thirds), being unrelated. -The balance of municipal costs (operating and capital) are for various types of `soft' services that are generally labour-intensive and more a function of population than density. - While there are potential municipal cost savings associated with more compact forms of development, the scale of this possible amount should be considered within the overall municipal context. Property Taxes and Utility Fees -Property taxes are a function of the assessed value of a property, with municipal tax rates set by the host municipality. Nearly half of the property taxes collected go to other levels of government than the local municipality, such as to the provincial government and other agencies. -Municipal utility fees for such services as water, sewage, and garbage, may also apply. -On average in Metro Vancouver, detached houses pay \$5,600 in property taxes; the amounts are lower for townhouses (\$3,000) and apartments (\$2,100). -These amounts vary by municipality as the mill rates vary by jurisdiction, and also vary within municipalities depending on the assessed values of properties. Of the total taxes and fees paid by typical households, a quarter to a third of that amount goes to utility fees Methodological Complexities -Defining, calculating, and attributing costs and revenues for different services by different asset classes or unit types can be a data and methodological challenge. -Conceptually, there are four categories: infrastructure (capital) costs and revenues, and service (operating) costs and revenues. -Some of these may be paid for by a developer as one-time charges during construction, be it through providing the infrastructure and / or paying DCCs, and some by residents in the form of ongoing property taxes and utility fees. - Some practical challenges for such calculations are defining `urban' or `suburban' development forms / densities for data collection and reporting purposes, and potentially attributing some costs and revenues to other non-residential land uses (such as commercial and industrial). - Many municipal services and associated costs are more a function of residential population level rather than housing density, and some services, such as capital-intensive infrastructure can benefit from economies of scale, while labour-intensive services do not. -There are also significant local considerations and contextual issues. Some municipal costs may be higher on an absolute basis in a high-density, established urban location because of `urban harshness' and increased complexities, but lower on a per unit or per capita basis because of the greater development densities. -Given these complexities and limitations, the expectations about the resulting values should beunderstood as high-level or estimates.},

  abstract = {Parking spaces are becoming strategic commodities in central urban areas. Nevertheless, few datasets allow to precisely measuring the use of these spaces in terms of population segments, activity types and duration. In order to document this issue, this paper proposes some empirical measures and methods regarding the use of parking spaces in a strategic urban area. This analysis is conducted with specific data collected during two recent large scale travel surveys held in the Greater Montreal Area. The Montreal Region has a long experience in conducting travel surveys with large samples of people. Actually, phone surveys on daily travel behaviours have been held for more than thirty years, approximately every five years, since 1970. Collected sample represent 5\% of the population (app. 70 000 households in 2003).  In the two latest surveys (1998 and 2003), a new question was added to gather data regarding the use of parking spaces in central urban areas. Car drivers heading towards these areas wereenquired regarding the type of parking space used. Parking spaces were classified according to their jurisdiction (private/public), location (indoor/on the street/outdoor) and rates (free/fee- charging/subsidized by the employer). Using these data, statistics describing the use of these spaces are developed. On the one hand, people benefiting from the various types of parking spaces are described in terms of residence location, demographic attributes and type of activity. On the other hand, parking accumulation profiles are developed and summarised by key indicators.},

Using Los Angeles County, California, as a case study, a framework is developed for assessing the changes of building stocks in cities (i.e., a generalizable framework for estimating the construction and deconstruction rates), the residence time of buildings and their materials, and the associated embedded environmental impacts. In Los Angeles, previous land-use decisions prove not easily reversible, and past building stock investments may continue to constrain the energy performance of buildings. The average age of the building stock has increased steadily since 1920 and more rapidly after the post--World War II construction surge in the 1950s. Buildings will likely endure for 60 years or longer, making this infrastructure a quasi-permanent investment. The long residence time, combined with the physical limitations on outward growth, suggest that the Los Angeles building stock is unlikely to have substantial spatial expansion in the future. The construction of buildings requires a continuous investment in material, monetary, and energetic resources, resulting in environmental impacts. The long residence time of structures implies a commitment to use and maintain the infrastructure, potentially creating barriers to an urban area's ability to improve energy efficiency. The immotility of buildings, coupled with future environmental goals, indicates that urban areas will be best positioned by instituting strategies that ensure reductions in life cycle (construction, use, and demolition) environmental impacts.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive parking inventories have never existed for U.S. cities. Because of this, many parking-related questions have never been answered. This uncertainty --- not knowing how much parking there is near a site or in a city --- is the motivation for this report. By presenting the first complete parking inventories for five U.S. cities, this research reveals an investment in parking that is out of balance with the current demand for parking in almost all cases, and even less in tune with what appears to be declining future demand. This is not merely scientifically interesting, it also has great practical significance for planners, property developers, investors and lenders. It uncovers an opportunity to build more efficient cities that contain fewer unused parking spaces and more of everything else.   Three trends make this research timely. First, transportation preferences are changing, especially in urban areas, and a smaller share of Americans drive today than in the recent past. Second, policymakers are starting to relax their parking minimums and in some cases replace them with parking maximums. Third, datasets related to parking are becoming more accessible.   Exhaustive high-resolution parking inventories can identify parking shortages, and expose parking surpluses. These inventories can support developers who cannot afford to build extra parking at the expense of the other parts of their projects, or policymakers who are ready to relax minimum parking requirements for new construction, or who are concerned about spending public works money on free parking. Either way, the research presented here  suggests that future developments should provide fewer parking spaces than past developments. And today's empty parking spaces can be seen as a land bank in some of the most convenient city locations. The parking inventories developed in this paper for New York, Philadelphia, Seattle, Des Moines, and Jackson, Wyoming reveal a lavish amount of parking. Parking spaces outnumber homes 27 to one in Jackson. Seattle's population density of 13 people per acre is less than half its parking density of 29 parking stalls per acre. Philadelphia's parking density is 3.7 times greater than that of homes. Des Moines has 83,141 households and 1.6 million parking spaces. New York is the only city in the study with more homes than parking, an outcome partially explained by the greater provision of public transit.  The parking inventories reveal monumental investments in parking. By calculating the median price of a square foot of land within each cell of a 500-meter hexagonal overlay, and making conservative assumptions about the construction costs of surface and structured parking, I am able to estimate the replacement cost of all of the parking in each city. This is explained in more detail in Appendix B. The 1.6 million parking spaces in Seattle's inventory have an estimated value, or a ``replacement cost,'' of \$35.8 billion, which is \$118,000 per Seattle household. Jackson is home to over 100,000 parking spaces that would cost \$711 million to replace, or \$192,000 per household. The per household share of the parking inventory in Des Moines and Philadelphia is \$77,000 and \$30,000 respectively. New York's per-household cost is \$6,570, a fraction of that of the other cities.  The amount of parking varies widely within cities and between cities. There is no ``normal'' amount of parking, but New York stands out as unique. New York's parking is worth \$20.6 billion, or \$15.2 billion less than Seattle's, even though New York has a population 12 times greater than Seattle. Seattle's per-household parking cost burden is 18 times greater than New York's.  Another difference between New York and the other inventoried cities is in the distribution of parking spaces across the map. The prominence of on-street parking in New York's mixture of parking types as a smoothing effect on parking access that contrasts with uneven parking distributions in the other cities. For example, in Seattle, Des Moines, and Philadelphia, substantial investments in structured and off-street surface parking contributed to downtown areas with more than 100 parking spaces per acre, and surrounding areas having a fraction of that amount.  The study also provides a description of the mixture of parking types which is further explored by using a decile analysis of land prices and parking supply. Where land is less expensive, here is more likely to be surface parking. And where land is more expensive, there is less likely to be surface parking. But what was surprising is that as land increases in price and surface parking begins to dissolve, the amount of parking in an area may still increase as parking spaces take shelter in new buildings. In a seeming paradox, parking is more pervasive where it is less visible.  These parking inventories are all dependent on available data. Data availability is improving but the inconsistency of schemas across cities is challenging. On-street parking data were available from the transportation department of just one city, Seattle. New York street parking data came from combining signage data with streets, a task that required skills in computer programming and database architecture. For the other three cities, on-street parking inventories were derived from the geometries of street linework. Parcel data was publicly available for all five cities, but each tax assessor recorded parking differently, making off-street structured parking inventories a custom job for each city. Almost all of the off-street surface parking data came from satellite or aerial imagery, yet these data differed in resolution and kind for each city. Despite the source data inconsistencies, the method used to build parking inventories for the five cities in this study can also generate parking inventories for other cities in the future. These inventories are just a start, and many questions will need to be asked --- and answered --- in future research.},

  abstract = {Road network information simplifies autonomous driving by providing strong priors about environments. It informs a robotic vehicle with where it can drive, models of what can be expected, and contextual cues that influence driving behaviors. Currently, however, road network information is manually generated using a combination of GPS survey and aerial imagery. These manual techniques are labor intensive and error prone. To fully exploit the benefits of digital imagery, these processes should be automated. As a step toward this goal, we present an algorithm that extracts the structure of a parking lot visible from a given aerial image. To minimize human intervention in the use of aerial imagery, we devise a self-supervised learning algorithm that automatically generates a set of parking spot templates to learn the appearance of a parking lot and estimates the structure of the parking lot from the learned model. The data set extracted from a single image alone is too small to sufficiently learn an accurate parking spot model. However, strong priors trained using large data sets collected across multiple images dramatically improve performance. Our self-supervised approach outperforms the prior alone by adapting the distribution of examples toward that found in the current image. A thorough empirical analysis compares leading state-of-the-art learning techniques on this problem.},

Planners mandate free parking to alleviate congestion, but end up distorting transportation choices, debasing urban design, damaging the economy, and degrading the environment. Ubiquitous free parking helps explain why our cities sprawl on a scale fit more for cars than for people, and why American motor vehicles now consume one-eighth of the world's total oil production.

  abstract = {Parking minimums have been criticized for requiring developers to build more parking than they would without regulation; however, to date, few studies have explored why there might be variation in how much parking is built or why developers might willingly build parking above the minimums. To answer these questions, I assembled a sample of residential and mixed-use developments approved for construction in Los Angeles between 2013 and 2018 and analyzed if any development or neighborhood characteristics predicted parking above the minimum. I also interviewed 11 developers and real-estate professionals about parking minimums. I found that parking minimums are binding except when they are smallest: developments generally provided about as much parking as they were required to do even as the amount of parking they were required to provide decreased. Only developments with the largest parking minimum reductions built significantly more parking than required. Additionally, developments were more likely to provide extra parking when located in denser neighborhoods where people are least likely to drive and most likely to travel by public transit or by foot. These neighborhoods have less preexisting parking, and developers are likely incentivized to capitalize on this shortage to build more parking. Finally, I found that market-rate developers build more parking in response to perceived market demand, pressure from financial lenders, and neighborhood opposition. Affordable housing developers, however, try to minimize the amount of parking built to ensure financial efficiency and build less parking overall.},

  abstract = {1.0 INTRODUCTION The specifications of this assignment required Stantec to assess four regional growth scenarios for HRM. The first scenario was to reflect Regional Municipal Planning Strategy goals for growth in designated urban (Regional Centre), suburban, and rural portions of the region. The second was to reflect continuation of recent trends that have fallen short of the RMPS goals. The third and fourth were to reflect stronger regional goals emphasizing greater concentration of growth in the core of the region. Stantec and its partners, Gardner Pinfold Consultants, were responsible to determine and compare public, private, and social costs and benefits anticipated from these scenarios over the period from 2011 to 2031. Stantec has also woven an assessment of the health impacts of alternative scenarios through the study to identify qualitative outcomes identifiable through the analysis of individual services. The report sets out a framework for Health Impact Assessment for the purpose and follows it to the conclusion of the study. 2.0 SETTLEMENT IN HRM Population in the area now defined as HRM has shifted erratically since the founding of Halifax in the mid-eighteenth century. Since the 1950s the trend has been strongly toward dispersion of residential population from the urban core. Today, HRM as a whole is one of the most dispersed urban areas in North America, when measured by overall population density within its municipal boundaries. A closer look at the Regional Centre and Suburban Area is more encouraging, as the Regional Centre, in particular, shows high levels of sustainable transportation use. Population quickly dissipates away from the core, however, and costs relative to comparable urban areas in Canada are evident in measures of network length for roadways, and water and wastewater networks servicing the existing Regional Centre and Suburban Area, as opposed to the rural portion of the region. 3.0 SCENARIO CREATION Altus Economic Consulting prepared comprehensive population, household, and labour force projections for HRM in 2004 that were updated in 2009. Stantec has employed these projections, with adjustments as necessary to account for trends apparent in recently released 2011 Census data. Housing unit additions by type calculated to 2031 based on the Altus projections have been distributed within the Regional Centre, and Suburban and Rural Areas of the region using land suitability assessment in GIS, assigning new housing units progressively to areas defined as most desirable/suitable by the GIS model. Related employment estimates were created by HRM staff using methods developed in the VISUM transportation model employed to assess impacts on the region's transportation network. 4.0 TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS There is a complex two-way relationship between road improvements and regional development patterns. Together with other factors, expanded regional roadways facilitate dispersed development, which in turn generates demand for further road capacity both at the regional and local level. This study addresses the latter aspect of this relationship in terms of the influence of development on transportation. The local road network must be extended with residential development in new areas of HRM. At the same time, additional residential development, depending on its scale and location influences use of the existing road network to degrees that may require strategic improvements. The distribution of development, furthermore, may influence the choice of mode of transportation, the vehicle trips required, and the time required for travel by citizens within the region. Stantec has quantified each of these factors for the four distribution scenarios to assess the influence of development patterns on the cost of transportation in the region. 5.0 WATER AND WASTEWATER SERVICES Municipal networks for water distribution, as well as for collection and disposal of wastewater and stormwater are normally extended in association with new roads constructed in the Regional Centre and Suburban Area of HRM. In the Rural Area, piped networks are not provided as homes rely on wells and onsite septic disposal, with less expensive ditch and culvert systems for stormwater collection. Stantec has assessed the cost of developing the required systems in each area of HRM and the overall cost of their development for all of HRM. 6.0 OTHER PUBLIC SERVICES A wide variety of services is provided to citizens through specialized facilities provided by the Municipality and the Province. While the form of facilities and the interaction between them and the citizens they serve varies considerably, their efficiency and adequacy is strongly associated with the distance between facilities and the public. For each distinct service provided, Stantec has calculated the cumulative distance between existing facilities and the new residential development distributed as assumed for each distribution scenario. We have also assessed the future adequacy of several facility networks to determine the potential need for new facilities under future distribution patterns. 7.0 PRIVATE UTILITIES Several important networked systems are provided to HRM citizens by private companies. Stantec assessed the extension of electricity, telecommunications, and natural gas networks to determine their cost under each distribution scenario. In the case of natural gas, which is being supplied within a limited area of the municipality, Stantec also assessed the potential extent of the future network so as to provide a basis for further estimation of its environmental benefits. 8.0 SUMMARY OF SERVICE IMPACTS Results of our analysis clearly show the benefits of concentrating new residential development. For nearly all services assessed, the best distribution scenario is Scenario B in which the maximum proportion (50 per cent) of new development is located in the Regional Centre. Of 26 measures ranked, Scenario B provides the best outcome for 22. The scenario ranks second in terms of increased transit use and obtains mixed results in terms of elementary and junior high school enrolment balance. It would however create the most stress on parkland supply of any scenario. Scenario A, which allocates 40 per cent of new development to the Regional Centre, generally ranks second, although it ranks ahead of Scenario B in terms of its positive impact on transit use. The current RMPS objective of locating 25 per cent of new residential development in the Regional Centre with 50 per cent in the Suburban Area and 25 per cent in the Rural Area generally ranks third with exceptions being water and wastewater improvements for which costs would be highest, school over and under enrolment, where it is at least tied for the best outcome for all three levels of schooling, and in terms of increased transit usage, in which it ranks very slightly behind the Trend Scenario, partly because achievement of the RMPS Goals would encourage more use of active transportation modes. Continuation of the current trend by which only 16 per cent of new residential development has located in the Regional Centre provides the worst outcome in all cases except for transit usage, where it shows 0.1 per cent edge over the RMPS Scenario, and travel time to the Materials Recycling Facility, where it ties the RMPS scenario. 9.0 ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC AND HEALTH IMPACTS Assessment of GHG emissions suggests that concentration of development will reduce locally generated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to a small degree. Economic assessment of costs to provide and maintain more extensive infrastructure, if sprawl is permitted to continue and for users to employ this infrastructure, suggests very substantial savings available. Between continuation of the current pattern of sprawl and the RMPS Goals, Gardner Pinfold has calculated nearly \$700 million in savings can be achieved. Taking into account the densest alternative considered for this study (Scenario B), modelling suggests more than \$3 billion in reduced costs. Health impacts were assessed qualitatively and Stantec has concluded that more condensed scenarios provide superior outcomes for six of nine factors considered to be related to community health. Evidence is ambivalent for the other three factors but does not alter the overall conclusions of this study},

  abstract = {More complexities in urban areas due to the existence of buildings with roofs made of various materials, roads and parking lots, diverse plant species and vehicles along with developed very high spatial resolution (VHR) remote sensing imageries lead to increase the difficulties of urban objects recognition. Defining human cognition semantic categories of land cover objects is proposed in this paper to improve the object-based scene analysis. After performing the segmentation algorithm, semantically feature fusion of the VHR imagery and Lidar DSM is performed in the context of object-based procedures. For this reason, high-level semantics composed of human cognition object categorization and visual--conceptual descriptions of land cover objects in the complex urban scene is used for low-level features measurement followed by classification rules generation. The pan-sharpened WorldView-2 satellite image and Lidar DSM over a complex urban area in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) are used to evaluate the capabilities of the proposed semantic object-based scene analysis. The evaluation of the obtained object recognition results shows the 93.98\% overall accuracy and 0.937 Kappa coefficient. Comparing the obtained semantic object recognition results with non-semantic object-based procedures indicates the improvements in overall accuracy for 20.68 and 2.18\% in object-based spectral and object-based spectral--structural classifications, respectively. Increasing the true positive pixels of the spectrally and height similar object categories (such as buildings and road), and using threshold training without requiring high-dimensional training samples are some of the advantages of the proposed semantic object-based scene analysis method.},

  abstract = {Public subsidy of transit services has increased dramatically in recent years, with little effect on overall ridership. Quite obviously, a clear understanding of the factors influencing transit ridership is central to decisions on investments in and the pricing and deployment of transit services. Yet the literature about the causes of transit use is quite spotty; most previous aggregate analyses of transit ridership have examined just one or a few systems, have not included many of the external, control variables thought to influence transit use, and have not addressed the simultaneous relationship between transit service supply and consumption. This study addresses each of these shortcomings by (1) conducting a cross-sectional analysis of transit use in 265 US urbanized areas, (2) testing dozens of variables measuring regional geography, metropolitan economy, population characteristics, auto/highway system characteristics, and transit system characteristics, and (3) constructing two-stage simultaneous equation regression models to account for simultaneity between transit service supply and consumption. We find that most of the variation in transit ridership among urbanized areas -- in both absolute and relative terms -- can be explained by factors outside of the control of public transit systems: (1) regional geography (specifically, area of urbanization, population, population density, and regional location in the US), (2) metropolitan economy (specifically, personal/household income), (3) population characteristics (specifically, the percent college students, recent immigrants, and Democratic voters in the population), and (4) auto/highway system characteristics (specifically, the percent carless households and non-transit/non-SOV trips, including commuting via carpools, walking, biking, etc.). While these external factors clearly go a long way toward determining the overall level of transit use in an urbanized area, we find that transit policies do make a significant difference. The observed range in both fares and service frequency in our sample could account for at least a doubling (or halving) of transit use in a given urbanized area. Controlling for the fact that public transit use is strongly correlated with urbanized area size, about 26\% of the observed variance in per capita transit patronage across US urbanized areas is explained in the models presented here by service frequency and fare levels. The observed influence of these two factors is consistent with both the literature and intuition: frequent service draws passengers, and high fares drive them away.},

The rise of ViT and its performance with a high success rate motivated the community to slowly replace the traditional convolutional neural networks in various computer vision tasks. This survey aims to review and compare the performances of ViT architectures designed for semantic segmentation using benchmarking datasets. This will be worthwhile for the community to yield knowledge regarding the implementations carried out in semantic segmentation and to discover more efficient methodologies using ViTs.},

  abstract = {The 2018 Regional Parking Study is the second regional-scale apartment parking study to be undertaken in the Metro Vancouver region. In a metropolitan area where six out of 10 new housing units built are in apartment buildings, the availability of timely data to inform appropriate apartment parking requirements is likely to continue. An excessive supply of parking represents an inefficient use of land and capital resources, especially in Urban Centres and areas along the Frequent Transit Network, and a missed opportunity to reflect evolving transportation choices and to reduce the cost of housing construction. The Regional Parking Study, a collaborative effort between TransLink and Metro Vancouver, draws out patterns to expand the knowledge base of practitioners and policymakers in member jurisdictions and the development community. Many of the patterns are consistent with expectations and reflect the success that the region has had in coordinating land use and transportation decisions. The findings also reveal opportunities to `right size' the amount of parking in apartment buildings for both motorized vehicles and bicycles, and highlight the opportunity to treat on-site and on-street parking as a system. The findings of the 2018 Regional Parking Study largely corroborate those in the 2012 Apartment Parking Study, and includes new insights about street parking supply and utilization. Apartment parking supply remains excessive relative to observed utilization. Apartment buildings close to frequent transit, whether bus or SkyTrain, have lower parking supply and utilization. The lower rates of parking utilization areassociated with higher transit use as measured by the number of bus boardings near the buildings, and this relationship is stronger for rental apartment sites. Street parking is inherently complex in mixed-use neighbourhoods. Some of the factors contributing to street parking use include visitors to non-residential land uses, such as restaurants, shops, and parks; apartment visitors on weekends, holidays, and special occasions; and some apartment residents parking on the street. Even with these factors, only a handful of surveyed street networks experienced persistently high street parking utilization. Finally, the 2018 Regional Parking Study highlights a challenge that remains unchanged from the 2012 Study. The design and capacity of current bicycle parking facilities in apartment buildings are discouraging their use by many residents. Looking ahead, practitioners and policymakers should be mindful of evolving mobility choices, technology, and consumer preferences, and the potential implications for vehicle ownership, parking demand, and parking requirements in  apartment buildings, on streets, and in other building structures. TransLink and Metro Vancouver will continue to look for opportunities to undertake and support research related to parking in accordance to regional policies, and to support the efforts of member jurisdictions to coordinate land use and transportation decisions.},

Judging the material to be of considerable interest in the context of urban economic transport theory and policy, and to rescue it from obscurity, we recommended to the Editor that it be published in the Journal of Urban Economics. The Editor graciously assented, subject to some editing. The statement provides an overview of Vickrey's thinkin on the technological implementation of efficient urban transport policy. The appendix to the statement presents "A preliminary Sketch of Possible Schemes for Automatic Toll Assessment with Reference to the Washington, DC, Metropolitan Area". Exhibit 51 is an essay, "Reaching an Economic Balance between Mass Transit and Provision for Individual Automobile Traffic". The appendix to that exhivit contains a derivation of Ramsey-Boiteux pricing in the context of urban transportation. Exhibit 52 deals with the "Construction of Tentative Fare Schedules for Washington, DC, Regional Rapid Transit System." Exhibit 53 is an essay on "The Economizing of Curb Parking Space - A suggestion for a new approach to parking meters". The total length was some 100 typewritten pages. To transform this material into a journal article, we decided to include the statement, moderately edited, along with the appendix on automatic toll assessment and the exhibit on curb parking space. We hope to find a venue for publication of some of the residual matter elsewhere. The article not only demonstrates Vickrey's creativity, economic intelligence, and farsightedness, but also provides further evidence that he is the source of pricing solutions to urban tranport problems. With the tremendous advances in technology over the last thirty-five years, his proposals are even more compelling now than they were in the originally formulated},

  abstract = {Par sa Politique de stationnement, la Ville de Montr{\'e}al veut faire du stationnement un outil de gestion strat{\'e}gique r{\'e}pondant {\`a} ses orientations en mati{\`e}re de mobilit{\'e} durable, d'am{\'e}nagement du territoire et de d{\'e}veloppement {\'e}conomique. Elle veut {\'e}galement mettre les citoyens au c{\oe}ur des priorit{\'e}s.  Le stationnement est un domaine complexe et d'une grande sensibilit{\'e}. S'y attaquer entra{\^i}ne in{\'e}vitablement des r{\'e}actions {\'e}motives de la part d'une foule d'acteurs concern{\'e}s puisque, dans bien des cas, des int{\'e}r{\^e}ts divergents sont mis en lumi{\`e}re.  Au fil des ans, diverses solutions ont {\'e}t{\'e} implant{\'e}es. Certaines de ces solutions pr{\'e}sentent un r{\'e}el int{\'e}r{\^e}t, alors que d'autres ont suscit{\'e} de vives critiques. Par le pass{\'e}, le stationnement n'a pas fait l'objet d'une planification globale. Sauf exception, les exercices de planification ont davantage {\'e}t{\'e} r{\'e}alis{\'e}s {\`a} petite {\'e}chelle.  Avec les ann{\'e}es et en tenant compte de l'{\'e}volution des pr{\'e}occupations en mati{\`e}re d'environnement et de qualit{\'e} de vie, une r{\'e}vision en profondeur de la gestion du stationnement est devenue essentielle. En effet, les pressions se sont accentu{\'e}es sur le stationnement en milieu urbain. La croissance soutenue du parc automobile, le renouveau d{\'e}mographique observ{\'e} dans les quartiers denses, la comp{\'e}titivit{\'e} des art{\`e}res commer{\c c}antes, l'adh{\'e}sion de plus en plus marqu{\'e}e de la population {\`a} la mobilit{\'e} durable et {\`a} un partage mieux {\'e}quilibr{\'e} du domaine public sont autant de facteurs qui militent en faveur d'une r{\'e}vision du r{\^o}le du stationnement dans l'environnement urbain. {\`A} cela s'ajoutent l'abondance de la signalisation et du morcellement de la gestion administrative du stationnement qui sont devenues une source de frustration pour les citoyens et les commer{\c c}ants. La vision de la Politique de stationnement consiste {\`a} :  Assurer une offre {\'e}quilibr{\'e}e en stationnement afin d'am{\'e}liorer la qualit{\'e} de vie des citoyens et d'assurer la vitalit{\'e} {\'e}conomique, tout en r{\'e}duisant la d{\'e}pendance {\`a} l'automobile et son impact sur l'environnement.  L'{\'e}quilibre recherch{\'e} vise {\`a} s'assurer que les besoins des citoyens ont {\'e}t{\'e} pris en consid{\'e}ration, sans pour autant accro{\^i}tre la quantit{\'e} de places de stationnement au point d'encourager les gens {\`a} d{\'e}laisser les transports actifs et collectifs. Dans le cadre de l'{\'e}laboration de cette politique, un portrait et un diagnostic ont {\'e}t{\'e} r{\'e}alis{\'e}s. Ils ont permis d'{\'e}tablir de grands constats, {\`a} savoir que pour la plupart des arrondissements, le stationnement sur rue constitue l'essentiel de l'offre, alors que les places tarif{\'e}es sont principalement concentr{\'e}es dans le centre de l'{\^i}le, notamment sur les art{\`e}res commer{\c c}antes. Malgr{\'e} l'existence de stationnements sur rue r{\'e}serv{\'e}s aux r{\'e}sidents (SRRR), le stationnement pour les r{\'e}sidents est difficile dans les quartiers multifonctionnels plus denses, regroupant des commerces et des p{\^o}les d'emplois. Au centre-ville, les places tarif{\'e}es sur rue sont souvent occup{\'e}es {\`a} plus de 85 \%, et ce, au-del{\`a} des p{\'e}riodes tarif{\'e}es. La signalisation est devenue tr{\`e}s complexe dans certains cas. En moyenne, nous trouvons 1,29 panneau par poteau, mais il arrive qu'un poteau compte jusqu'{\`a} six panneaux. Pour ce qui est du stationnement hors rue au centre-ville, qui repr{\'e}sente plus de 75 \% de l'offre totale, il est contr{\^o}l{\'e} par le secteur priv{\'e} {\`a} pr{\`e}s de 99 \%, ce qui emp{\^e}che le d{\'e}veloppement d'une strat{\'e}gie tarifaire favorisant la rotation et, par cons{\'e}quent, l'utilisation des places de stationnement par un plus grand nombre d'usagers. Le portrait et le diagnostic qui ont {\'e}t{\'e} produits ont {\'e}galement abord{\'e} les exigences r{\'e}glementaires en mati{\`e}re de stationnement, le partage des comp{\'e}tences et la gouvernance. La vision de la Politique de stationnement illustre la complexit{\'e} du stationnement dans le syst{\`e}me de transport d'une ville. Elle tient compte de la diversit{\'e} des secteurs, de la diff{\'e}rence des besoins des usagers et de la multitude d'acteurs en pr{\'e}sence, tant priv{\'e}s que publics. La politique aborde donc le stationne ment comme un {\'e}l{\'e}ment d{\'e}terminant du plan de mobilit{\'e} en voie d'{\'e}laboration. Elle s'appuie sur quatre principes directeurs : Ces principes directeurs visent {\`a} r{\'e}pondre aux diff{\'e}rents besoins en stationnement des r{\'e}sidents, des navetteurs, des visiteurs et des consommateurs, sans oublier les activit{\'e}s de livraison.   Principes directeurs 1 Simplifier et harmoniser les pratiques municipales afin d'assurer une meilleure coh{\'e}rence de la gestion du stationnement. 2 Moduler le stationnement en fonction de l'offre en transports collectifs et actifs et des caract{\'e}ristiques locales, notamment la densit{\'e} de population et le volume d'emplois. 3 Optimiser le stationnement au centre-ville et sur les art{\`e}res commer{\c c}antes afin de favoriser la vitalit{\'e} {\'e}conomique. 4 Satisfaire les besoins des r{\'e}sidents dans les secteurs denses afin d'offrir un v{\'e}ritable choix en ce qui concerne les modes de transport collectif et actif. B{\'e}n{\'e}ficiant d'une meilleure connaissance de l'{\'e}tat du stationnement {\`a} Montr{\'e}al, bas{\'e}e sur une vision claire et des principes directeurs, la Politique de stationnement s'articule autour de six strat{\'e}gies : La gestion strat{\'e}gique du stationnement passe in{\'e}vitablement par une r{\'e}vision du r{\^o}le des diff{\'e}rents acteurs municipaux concern{\'e}s, car le morcellement actuel des responsabilit{\'e}s entra{\^i}ne des iniquit{\'e}s au sein m{\^e}me de la ville. L'id{\'e}e n'est certes pas de proposer des solutions uniformes {\`a} l'{\'e}chelle de la ville afin de respecter les caract{\'e}ristiques des diff{\'e}rents milieux en pr{\'e}sence. Cependant, il va de soi que certaines pratiques gagneront {\`a} {\^e}tre mieux encadr{\'e}es. Ces strat{\'e}gies cherchent {\`a} satisfaire les besoins des diff{\'e}rentes client{\`e}les, tout en respectant la vision du Plan de transport et des diff{\'e}rents documents strat{\'e}giques adopt{\'e}s par la Ville et l'agglom{\'e}ration, notamment le Sch{\'e}ma d'am{\'e}nagement et de d{\'e}veloppement de l'agglom{\'e}ration de Montr{\'e}al, le Plan d'urbanisme et le Plan strat{\'e}gique de d{\'e}veloppement durable de la communaut{\'e} montr{\'e}alaise. Elles impliquent le d{\'e}ploiement de plusieurs mesures bien concr{\`e}tes qui s'{\'e}chelonneront dans le temps.  Toutefois, Montr{\'e}al s'engage {\`a} mettre en {\oe}uvre prioritairement les actions suivantes : La gestion strat{\'e}gique du stationnement passe in{\'e}vitablement par une r{\'e}vision du r{\^o}le des diff{\'e}rents acteurs concern{\'e}s au sein de l'administration municipale, car le morcellement actuel des responsabilit{\'e}s entra{\^i}ne des iniquit{\'e}s au sein m{\^e}me de la Ville. Strat{\'e}gies 1 Migrer vers le stationnement intelligent. 2 Cr{\'e}er un environnement propice au d{\'e}ploiement d'une mobilit{\'e} plus durable. 3 Arrimer la gestion du stationnement aux objectifs de mise en valeur du territoire. 4 Mettre en place une nouvelle approche tarifaire. 5 R{\'e}viser l'encadrement r{\'e}glementaire. 6 Revoir la gouvernance et la gestion des activit{\'e}s. Actions prioritaires 1 La simplification et l'harmonisation des pratiques municipales de gestion et de tarification du stationnement. 2 La cr{\'e}ation d'un organisme municipal de gestion du stationnement. 3 La simplification de la signalisation du stationnement sur rue},

  abstract = {Parking is a key element of the street and highway system. Parking supply affects driving demand by changing the underlying cost structure associated with mode choice decisions. It also affects levels of auto ownership by changing the cost of auto ownership. These two facts combine to make parking management an important and powerful tool for both traffic and air-quality management. A pilot analysis of demographics, highway and transit access, and off-street parking in two New York City neighborhoods strongly suggests that the provision of residential off-street parking affects commuting behavior. Moreover, the type of parking provision plays a strong role in determining mode share. Accessory parking that is adjacent to a home, in a garage or driveway, seems more likely to generate auto commutes than does parking in commercial centralized lots. This analysis, which was followed by testing plausible development scenarios, shows that the city's residential off-street parking regulations will undermine its own vision for a sustainable future.},

This study aims to investigate the joint effect of built environment and parking availability on car ownership and use based on a household travel survey conducted in Changchun, China. The binary logistic model was first employed to investigate the determinants of the car ownership in Changchun. Next, this study examined the potential impacts of the built environment and parking availability on car use for the journey to work. The result shows that built environment and parking availability can be both significantly associated with car ownership and use after controlling for the socio-economic characteristics. Moreover, in contrast with the model ignoring the parking availability, the model for car use considering the joint effect fit the data better. The results indicate that car dependency depends on the joint effect of the built environment and parking availability. These results suggest that transit-oriented urban expansion and compact land use can contribute to reducing car commuting. Meanwhile, parking restrictions at both trip start and end would be effective for sustainable transport because parking oversupply could encourage more car dependency.},

There are currently several high-resolution satellite imagery datasets that are publicly available. However, the associated ground-truth annotations are limited to road, building, and land use, while the annotations of other geographic objects or attributes are mostly not available. To bridge the gap, we present Grab-Pklot, the first high-resolution and context-enriched satellite imagery dataset for parking lot detection. Our dataset consists of 1344 satellite images with the ground-truth annotations of carparks in Singapore. Motivated by the observation that carparks are mostly co-appear with other geographic objects, we associate each satellite image in our dataset with the surrounding contextual information of road and building, given in the format of multi-channel images. As a side contribution, we present a fusion-based segmentation approach to demonstrate that the parking lot detection accuracy can be improved by modeling the correlations between parking lots and other geographic objects. Experiments on our dataset provide baseline results as well as new insights into the challenges and opportunities in parking lot detection from satellite images.},

Rarely do they look at spatially integrating parking, land use and transport policy. Parking however influences the spatial distribution of transport use and the viability of developments.

  abstract = {Parking has always been a thorny problem in urban transport systems. Parking availability and parking reservation management may have a significant influence on the travel behavior of household travelers. This paper explores the morning commute for household travels by considering parking space constraint and the parking reservation mechanism in a two-mode transport system. Household travelers depart from home to their children's school by car or by rail and then go to work alone. For household travelers who drive, some household travelers have reserved parking spaces while other household travelers must compete for public ones on a first-come-first-served (FCFS) basis. When household travelers do not have a parking spot, they use rail transit for their commute. We derive ten equilibrium departure patterns based on the school-work time difference, the number of parking spots and the ratio of reserved parking spots. With these equilibrium departure patterns, we thoroughly discuss the impact of school-work time difference on the total travel cost of auto travelers and parking reservation ratio. It is found that, given the school-work time difference, appropriate parking reservation allocation can minimize the total system travel cost. Then, the system performance, including total system travel cost and total congestion cost, is examined by regulating the parking supply, the parking reservation allocation and the school-work time difference. We found that there is a unique optimal parking supply to minimize the total system travel cost, and appropriate staggering policy can alleviate traffic congestion and thus improves social welfare. Finally, numerical analysis is conducted to verify the findings, and the Pareto frontier for system performance is analyzed. Traffic authorities can select the optimal solution based on the preferences of traffic indicators to develop effective strategies to manage morning commuting of household travels with parking space constraint. The study demonstrates that implementing reasonable staggering policy and efficient parking management can effectively promote efficiency of urban morning commuting systems and reduce social costs for household travelers.},

  abstract = {Very-high-resolution (VHR) land cover and land use (LCLU) is an essential baseline data for understanding fine-scale interactions between humans and the heterogeneous landscapes of urban environments. In this study, we developed a Fine-resolution, Large-area Urban Thematic information Extraction (FLUTE) framework to address multiple challenges facing large-area, high-resolution urban mapping, including the view angle effect, high intraclass and low interclass variation, and multiscale land cover types. FLUTE builds upon a teacher-student deep learning architecture, and includes two new feature extraction modules -- Scale-aware Parsing Module (SPM) and View-aware Embedding Module (VEM). Our model was trained with a new benchmark database containing 52.43 million labeled pixels (from 2014 to 2017 NAIP airborne Imagery) to capture diverse LCLU types and spatial patterns. We assessed the credibility of FLUTE by producing a 1-meter resolution database named UrbanWatch for 22 major cities across the conterminous United States. UrbanWatch contains nine LCLU classes -- building, road, parking lot, tree canopy, grass/shrub, water, agriculture, barren, and others, with an overall accuracy of 91.52\%. We have further made UrbanWatch freely accessible to support urban-related research, urban planning and management, and community outreach efforts: https://urbanwatch.charlotte.edu. {\copyright} 2022 Elsevier Inc.},
